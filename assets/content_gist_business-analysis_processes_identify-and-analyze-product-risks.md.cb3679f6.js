These are termed as product risks. When product risks that have a detrimental effect aren&#39;t tackled, they can result in product failures.</p><h3 id="activities-involved" tabindex="-1">Activities Involved <a class="header-anchor" href="#activities-involved" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Activities Involved&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Identifying Product Risks</strong>: This involves pinpointing risks and documenting their traits that might influence the business analysis tasks or the product.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performing Qualitative Risk Analysis</strong>: Here, product risks are prioritized for in-depth analysis or action by evaluating and taking into account their likelihood and consequences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performing Quantitative Risk Analysis</strong>: This involves analyzing numerically the impact of pinpointed product risks on business goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Planning Risk Responses</strong>: This stage revolves around crafting options and actions to tackle product risks. Responses might involve alterations or the identification of additional product requisites, or even more project tasks, to capitalize on opportunities or deal with potential points of failure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Completely eliminate the threat.</li><li><strong>Transfer</strong>: Pass on the impact of the threat to another party.</li><li><strong>Mitigate</strong>: Diminish the likelihood or consequence of the threat.</li><li><strong>Accept</strong>: Recognize the threat but refrain from any action unless the risk transpires.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Strategies for Positive Risks or Opportunities</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Exploit</strong>: Guarantee that the opportunity comes to fruition.</li><li><strong>Enhance</strong>: Boost the likelihood or positive outcomes of the opportunity.</li><li><strong>Share</strong>: Assign all or part of the opportunity&#39;s ownership to another entity.</li><li><strong>Accept</strong>: Capitalize on the opportunity if it emerges but don&#39;t actively chase it.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Implementing Risk Responses</strong>: This is about putting into action the agreed-upon risk responses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring Risks</strong>: This involves supervising the execution of agreed-upon risk responses, keeping track of identified product risks, overseeing residual risks, recognizing new risks, and gauging the efficacy of the risk process.</p></li></ol><h3 id="considerations-during-the-process" tabindex="-1">Considerations during the process <a class="header-anchor" href="#considerations-during-the-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Considerations during the process&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Assumptions</strong>: These are elements deemed true or certain without tangible evidence. Every assumption carries a risk. This risk corresponds to what would happen if the assumption proves incorrect.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraints</strong>: These are factors that restrict the operation of a portfolio, program, project, or process. In the realm of business analysis, constraints are factors that hamper the creation or execution of a solution. Risks may be identified if these constraints are breached.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dependencies</strong>: These are logical links between two or more entities. Risks may be identified if these dependencies aren&#39;t fulfilled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Issues</strong>: These are unsettled points or matters that are under discussion or in dispute. A risk might transform into an issue if the risk event happens and the response plan isn&#39;t up to the mark. Conversely, unresolved issues might give birth to new risks.</p></li></ul><p>Transforming assumptions, constraints, dependencies, or yet-to-be-resolved issues into risks enables product teams to manage these elements more proactively. This is because risks typically undergo analysis at more regular intervals.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="analysis-approach" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Analysis Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#analysis-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Analysis Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Analysis Approach provides a structured way of understanding how the analysis will be conducted for a specific initiative or project.
