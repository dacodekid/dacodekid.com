However, solution design goes beyond what is specified by business analysis alone, delving into areas that may require specialized knowledge in disciplines like IT architecture, engineering, or domain-specific expertise.</p><h2 id="role-of-business-and-enterprise-architecture" tabindex="-1">Role of Business and Enterprise Architecture <a class="header-anchor" href="#role-of-business-and-enterprise-architecture" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Role of Business and Enterprise Architecture&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When feasible and beneficial, the solution design should leverage the existing features of the business and enterprise architecture.
