After estimating these lower-level tasks, the estimates are then aggregated to provide a total estimate for the project or larger work package. This approach often relies on a decomposition model to identify these lower-level tasks.</p><h2 id="overview" tabindex="-1">Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In Bottom-Up Estimating, the idea is <mark>to dissect the larger</mark> work package or project scope <mark>into smaller, more manageable tasks</mark>. These tasks are then estimated in terms of duration, resources, or cost. Once all lower-level estimates are made, they are summed up to produce the overall project estimate. The accuracy of Bottom-Up Estimating is generally higher compared to other techniques like top-down estimating, particularly because it focuses on detailed analysis.</p><h2 id="process-and-methodology" tabindex="-1">Process and Methodology <a class="header-anchor" href="#process-and-methodology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Process and Methodology&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Decomposition</strong>: The first step is to break down the larger work package or project scope into smaller, individual tasks or components.
