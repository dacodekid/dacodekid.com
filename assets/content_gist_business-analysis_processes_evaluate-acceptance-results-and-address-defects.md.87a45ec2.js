The primary advantage of executing this process is to make well-informed determinations on the release of the whole or a segment of a solution, and whether there&#39;s a necessity for alterations, rectifications, or enhancements.</p><h3 id="understanding-the-process" tabindex="-1">Understanding the Process <a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-the-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Understanding the Process&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This procedure emphasizes contrasting the acceptance criteria with the acceptance testing results. The objective is to provide guidance on addressing instances where some facets of a solution might not meet its designated acceptance criteria. The scope of this testing can range from a comprehensive solution release to just a single business scenario, which could be derived from multiple user stories.</p><p>Notably, the emphasis is on the outcomes of the comparison rather than the tests themselves. This distinction aligns with the prevalent industry practice where roles involved in business analysis are separate from those handling testing. While the testing roles usually handle the pass/fail aspect, business analysis is crucial to gauge the scale and severity of defects, deduce their root cause, recognize associated risks, and put forth suggestions to rectify them. Within these recommendations, business impacts, repair costs, or workaround costs are assessed alongside the implications and costs of rolling out the solution without addressing existing defects.</p><h3 id="sources-of-test-results" tabindex="-1">Sources of Test Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#sources-of-test-results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sources of Test Results&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Test outcomes vital for evaluating acceptance criteria might originate from:</p><ul><li>Exploratory tests and user acceptance tests.</li><li>Day-in-the-life (DITL) tests.</li><li>Preproduction or simulated production testing.</li><li>Functionality tests within a scenario.</li><li>Nonfunctional requirements tests. For an in-depth exploration of testing methodologies, one should refer to Section 6.6 of the Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide.</li></ul><p>In settings like manufacturing or construction that have consistent monitoring and acceptance testing, any discrepancies between outcomes and criteria are evaluated to discern trends. For software solutions with automated regression testing in place, there&#39;s an opportunity to identify patterns in results that don&#39;t meet the criteria.</p><h3 id="evaluation-steps" tabindex="-1">Evaluation Steps <a class="header-anchor" href="#evaluation-steps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Evaluation Steps&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The process of evaluation encompasses pinpointing the core cause of any disparity or flaw. This could lead to a cost-benefit analysis of addressing the defect. Suggested ways to handle the defect might encompass:</p><ul><li>Feasible workarounds that don&#39;t affect other functionalities or result in unexpected product behaviors.</li><li>Potential product modifications, possibly necessitating a change request.</li><li>Adjustments in measurement techniques or results.</li><li>Recognizing the need for a deeper dive into the technical origins of the flaw.</li><li>Informing customers and users to ensure correct product usage.</li></ul><p>Typically, the evaluation and addressing of defects transpire whenever there&#39;s a need for a go/no-go or release decision regarding a solution component. However, it can also take place when addressing product flaws detected post solution deployment.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="acceptance-criteria" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Acceptance Criteria</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#acceptance-criteria" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Acceptance Criteria](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Acceptance criteria outline the specific conditions that need to be met for a product or solution to be accepted by stakeholders. These criteria offer a clear description of the functionality, performance, and other attributes the final deliverable should possess to satisfy stakeholder expectations.</p><h4 id="actual-acceptance-results" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.html">Actual Acceptance Results</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#actual-acceptance-results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Actual Acceptance Results](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Actual acceptance results represent the actual observations and outcomes derived when the acceptance tests are executed.
