This tool is often used during the Strategy Analysis phase or as part of Stakeholder Engagement to visually articulate how closely stakeholders are related to the solution. It falls under the visual modeling techniques in the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK).</p><h2 id="objective" tabindex="-1">Objective <a class="header-anchor" href="#objective" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objective&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The primary goal of an Onion Diagram is to analyze stakeholders by representing the strength or significance of their relationships to the solution. Stakeholders closest to the core of the onion have the most direct or strong relationship to the solution. Those on the outer layers have a less direct relationship. This information can be vital for stakeholder engagement strategies, defining requirements, and effective communication.</p><h2 id="structure" tabindex="-1">Structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Structure&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The diagram consists of concentric circles, resembling the layers of an onion.
