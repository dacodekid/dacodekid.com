This process ensures that the elicitation activities are organized in a manner that maximizes their effectiveness. It ensures clarity among participants about their roles and the expected outcomes of the elicitation activity.</p><h3 id="significance" tabindex="-1">Significance <a class="header-anchor" href="#significance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Significance&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p>Elicitation preparation is essentially the groundwork carried out before embarking on the actual elicitation activity.</p></li><li><p>The materials prepared serve to aid the facilitator, making certain that the elicitation is productive, and the time allocated with stakeholders is optimized.</p></li><li><p>In more extensive elicitation scenarios, the preparation might be even more time-intensive than the elicitation itself.</p></li><li><p>The extent of preparation varies based on the elicitation&#39;s aim and the technique chosen. For instance:</p><ul><li>For large workshops, guiding documents might be drafted to streamline discussions.</li><li>When using collaborative games, the game&#39;s setup and a clear instruction manual will be part of the preparation.</li><li>Informal notes might also be prepared to assist in facilitating the session. These notes can also be a way to gauge the progress against what was intended and modify plans for upcoming elicitation activities.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="key-activities" tabindex="-1">Key Activities <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-activities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Activities&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Objective Setting:</strong> Each elicitation activity should have a clear objective. This is essentially the primary reason for undertaking the elicitation. The activity should yield value, justifying the time and resources invested.</p></li><li><p><strong>Participant Identification:</strong> It&#39;s essential to determine who will participate in the elicitation activity. Choosing the wrong participants can lead to inefficiencies or not meeting the objective. Participants who are unfamiliar with the subject matter or the elicitation techniques might need additional training or time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resource Identification:</strong> Some activities necessitate supporting materials or access to current systems and documents. Securing these resources is part of the preparation process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Question Formulation:</strong> Before conducting the elicitation, it&#39;s crucial to outline the questions that will guide the session. This ensures that the activity&#39;s objectives are met. Additionally, the business analyst should also plan how the elicitation results will be documented and if any help is needed for the elicitation, and collaborate with those resources beforehand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Agenda Setting:</strong> Clearly defining the topics of discussion or exploration and establishing time limits can help participants know what&#39;s expected of them. If participants need to do any groundwork before the session, they should be consulted. Relevant preparation materials, such as presentations or models, should be shared in advance. Sometimes, analysis models might be crafted as part of the preparation to guide the elicitation activity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scheduling:</strong> It&#39;s vital to allocate suitable durations for each stakeholder group. Also, securing necessary tools and materials, including the meeting room and equipment like projectors, is part of the preparation.</p></li></ol><p>The process of preparing for elicitation ensures that all activities are streamlined, participants are well-informed, and the necessary tools and materials are in place. This results in an effective and value-driven elicitation process.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="elicitation-approach" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Elicitation Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#elicitation-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Elicitation Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The elicitation approach involves defining strategies and methods to gather necessary information from stakeholders.
