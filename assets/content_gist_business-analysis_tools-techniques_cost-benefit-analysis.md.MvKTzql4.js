Its primary aim is to compare the benefits provided by a portfolio component, program, or project against its costs. The objective is to identify the most viable option from a set of alternatives. The results of the cost-benefit analysis are commonly included in the business case, serving as a basis to demonstrate why a particular solution option is considered the most viable choice.</p><h2 id="required-skills-and-collaboration" tabindex="-1">Required Skills and Collaboration <a class="header-anchor" href="#required-skills-and-collaboration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Required Skills and Collaboration&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Performing a cost-benefit analysis requires a certain level of financial analysis expertise. Business analysis professionals may <mark>often collaborate with financial analysts</mark> within their organization to assist in this work. This ensures that the analysis is grounded in sound financial principles.</p><h2 id="organizational-standards-and-valuation-techniques" tabindex="-1">Organizational Standards and Valuation Techniques <a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-standards-and-valuation-techniques" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Organizational Standards and Valuation Techniques&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Organizations often have specific standards that dictate when and how to perform a cost-benefit analysis. These standards might include which financial valuation methods should be employed. At least one valuation technique is applied to make the financial assessment, with these techniques being defined in specific sections of business analysis guides or organizational policy documents.</p><h2 id="role-in-evaluation-of-solution-performance" tabindex="-1">Role in Evaluation of Solution Performance <a class="header-anchor" href="#role-in-evaluation-of-solution-performance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Role in Evaluation of Solution Performance&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the context of evaluating the performance of a solution, cost-benefit analysis serves as a way to determine the business value of the solution. It helps assess whether the actual benefits match or exceed the expected benefits in relation to the costs incurred. Conducting a cost-benefit analysis during this phase can be particularly useful in determining whether the recommendations made are likely to be cost-effective.</p><h2 id="disadvantages" tabindex="-1">Disadvantages <a class="header-anchor" href="#disadvantages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Disadvantages&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Limitation in Quantifying Benefits</strong>: Not all benefits can be easily quantified or translated into monetary terms. This can lead to an imbalanced analysis that overemphasizes quantifiable benefits while neglecting qualitative factors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time-Consuming</strong>: The process can be time-intensive, requiring the collection and analysis of various types of data. This could delay decision-making processes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assumption-Based</strong>: The accuracy of a cost-benefit analysis is highly dependent on the assumptions made, such as discount rates, future economic conditions, and so on. Inaccurate assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Short-term Focus</strong>: Cost-benefit analysis often concentrates on immediate costs and benefits, which may neglect long-term implications, including sustainability or social impacts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risk of Subjectivity</strong>: The assignment of monetary value to variables can introduce subjectivity, especially if there are no market rates to base the valuation upon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Financial Valuation Emphasis</strong>: The method emphasizes financial aspects, potentially overlooking other forms of value, such as social or environmental benefits, which may be aligned with organizational objectives or stakeholder needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resource Constraints</strong>: In organizations with limited resources, performing an in-depth cost-benefit analysis might be challenging, affecting the reliability of the results.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complexity</strong>: For large projects with multiple stakeholders, interdependencies, and fluctuating variables, a cost-benefit analysis can become complex and difficult to interpret accurately.</p></li></ol>',10),o=[s];function l(r,c,d,h,u,f){return a(),i("div",null,o)}const b=e(n,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,b as default};
