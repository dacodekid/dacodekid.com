This approach is especially useful for simplifying complex objects or concepts by segmenting them into discrete elements. The result is a model that is both easy to produce and understandable to stakeholders.</p><h3 id="typical-use-cases-for-decomposition-models" tabindex="-1">Typical Use Cases for Decomposition Models: <a class="header-anchor" href="#typical-use-cases-for-decomposition-models" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Typical Use Cases for Decomposition Models:&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Estimation</strong>: In the context of estimating scope, deliverables, or work products, decomposition models offer a way to identify elements that need separate estimation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business Analysis Planning</strong>: It assists in detailing out business analysis tasks, activities, and deliverables.
