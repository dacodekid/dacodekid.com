It aims to ensure that all approved versions of configuration items are stored and protected in a manner that enables easy recovery while maintaining the integrity of the stored items.</p><h3 id="key-components" tabindex="-1">Key Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Components&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Configuration Items</strong>: These are the specific assets that are placed under configuration management. They could be hardware, software, documentation, or any other elements necessary for a project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuration Identification</strong>: This process helps in identifying configuration items for a project. It provides unique identifiers and a classification structure for each configuration item.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuration Control</strong>: This involves the evaluation, approval or disapproval, and implementation of changes to configuration items. Formal mechanisms are in place to control and update configuration items and their documentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuration Status Accounting</strong>: This is a record-keeping system of all configuration items. It keeps track of changes, statuses, and the individuals who authorized those changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuration Audits</strong>: These are conducted to ensure that the current design and development outputs of a project are consistent with its documented requirements.</p></li></ul><h3 id="key-features" tabindex="-1">Key Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Features&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Documentation</strong>: All changes, the reasoning behind them, and any associated impacts are comprehensively documented.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tracking Process</strong>: A systematic approach is used to follow change requests from initiation through resolution, including status updates at regular intervals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Approval Levels</strong>: Different levels of hierarchy may be involved in authorizing changes. These approval levels are predefined and documented.</p></li><li><p><strong>Verification and Validation</strong>: Before a change is implemented, it is verified and validated to ensure conformance to requirements and to assess any possible ripple effects on dependent items.</p></li><li><p><strong>Baseline Management</strong>: CMS allows for the establishment of baselines at various stages of the project, providing a stable foundation for further development.</p></li></ul><p>The primary goal of a CMS is to ensure that any changes to configuration items are made in a systematic, traceable, and repeatable manner. This helps in mitigating risks associated with changes and ensures that the project remains aligned with its objectives and requirements.</p>',7),o=[i];function r(c,l,m,d,u,g){return t(),n("div",null,o)}const f=e(s,[["render",r]]);export{h as __pageData,f as default};
