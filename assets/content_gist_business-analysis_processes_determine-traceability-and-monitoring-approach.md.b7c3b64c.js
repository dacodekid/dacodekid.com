This process defines how any alterations in requirements are overseen. The main advantage here is the tailoring of the traceability level and the structure of the requirements change management procedure according to the situation at hand.</p><p>Key components of this process are illustrated in Figures 8-2 and 8-3, presenting the inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs, as well as the data flow diagram respectively.</p><h3 id="core-aspects-of-the-approach" tabindex="-1">Core Aspects of the Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#core-aspects-of-the-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Core Aspects of the Approach&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The traceability and monitoring approach focuses on outlining traceability and change management methodologies for portfolios, programs, projects, or products. For optimal outcomes, this approach should:</p><ol><li><p>Ensure that the traceability process minimizes oversight of requirements in the final outcome.</p></li><li><p>Advocate for a traceability procedure that is efficient and not cumbersome.</p></li><li><p>Guarantee that the change management process aligns with business or project goals.</p></li><li><p>Simplify the implementation of necessary alterations through the change management process.</p></li><li><p>Align the traceability and change management strategies with organizational standards, fulfill regulatory stipulations, and prepare for future demands. This includes offering invaluable insights about the product beyond the project&#39;s timeframe.</p></li></ol><h3 id="components-related-to-traceability" tabindex="-1">Components Related to Traceability <a class="header-anchor" href="#components-related-to-traceability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Components Related to Traceability&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The facets of the approach dealing with traceability may encompass:</p><ul><li>Determining objects that need tracing.</li><li>Deciding on the granularity of detail in traceability.</li><li>Pinpointing relationships that need establishment and maintenance.</li><li>Deciding where these relationships will be recorded. This could involve requirement attributes, a traceability matrix, or certain tools meant for managing requirements.</li><li>Understanding the various stages of the requirement lifecycle, such as approval, deferral, or rejection.</li></ul><h3 id="components-related-to-change-management" tabindex="-1">Components Related to Change Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#components-related-to-change-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Components Related to Change Management&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Aspects of this approach pertinent to change management could include:</p><ul><li>Procedures for proposing changes to requirements.</li><li>Review mechanisms for these changes.</li><li>Documentation strategies for change management decisions.</li><li>Communication methods for any alterations in requirements.</li><li>Processes for updating requirements, models, traceability, and other relevant product details post change approval.</li><li>Defining roles and responsibilities for the requirements change procedure.</li></ul><h3 id="traceability-approach" tabindex="-1">Traceability Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#traceability-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Traceability Approach&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This approach demarcates the requirements blueprint used to relate requirements, models, and other related product data. The exact items that need tracing should be explicitly mentioned as traceability requirements fluctuate between portfolios, programs, projects, and products. Regardless of the life cycle adhered to, decisions about traceability should prioritize both immediate and future benefits of curating and retaining traceability details. Traceability isn&#39;t just about product details; it can also be applied to deliverables or aspects not related to business analysis, such as product design or development. For more detailed insights on traceability, refer to Sections 3.4.10 and 5.2.1 in &quot;Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide&quot;.</p><h3 id="change-management-process" tabindex="-1">Change Management Process <a class="header-anchor" href="#change-management-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Change Management Process&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This process lays out how alterations to product data are managed throughout the project&#39;s duration. Depending on the project&#39;s life cycle, the requirements change procedure can differ. For instance, a project with a predictive life cycle might employ a structured change management method, while an adaptive life cycle project may not, given the inherent expectation of evolving requirements in the latter. For comprehensive guidelines on structuring requirements change procedures, one can refer to Section 3.4.14 in &quot;Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide&quot;.</p><hr><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="analysis-approach" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Analysis Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#analysis-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Analysis Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Analysis Approach defines the overall strategy for planning and performing the business analysis tasks.
