This technique differs from traditional estimation techniques like story points or time-based estimates and is commonly used for agile projects where the scope of work is often fluid and subject to change.</p><h2 id="overview" tabindex="-1">Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In Affinity Estimating, team members collaboratively categorize PBIs into groups based on their relative size or effort required to complete them. It&#39;s an interactive and participative approach that facilitates a better understanding of the workload and aids in planning sprints or releases. Teams often use familiar terms such as <mark>T-shirt sizes (Small, Medium, Large, Extra-Large)</mark> to establish a scale for estimation. These T-shirt sizes serve as an intuitive, less granular way of assessing the relative effort for each PBI.</p><h2 id="process-and-methodology" tabindex="-1">Process and Methodology <a class="header-anchor" href="#process-and-methodology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Process and Methodology&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Initial Sorting</strong>: All PBIs are laid out, and team members individually or collectively categorize them into T-shirt sizes or groups of similar size.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discussion</strong>: The team discusses any disagreements or clarifications needed, ensuring a shared understanding of what each category or T-shirt size represents in terms of work effort.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finalization</strong>: Post-discussion, PBIs are moved to their final categories, effectively producing a relative estimate of the workload.</p></li><li><p><strong>Validation</strong>: Occasionally, teams may opt to validate the affinity estimates by comparing them to more granular estimation methods or historical data.</p></li></ol><h2 id="benefits" tabindex="-1">Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefits&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Quick Estimation</strong>: Affinity Estimating is generally <mark>faster than other methods</mark> because it&#39;s less granular and based on intuitive understanding.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaborative</strong>: The technique encourages team participation and generates collective intelligence, ensuring a well-rounded perspective.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Effective for estimating a large number of PBIs, particularly useful during initial stages of a project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: As the project evolves, so can the affinity estimates, making it an adaptable technique.</p></li></ol><h2 id="use-case" tabindex="-1">Use-case <a class="header-anchor" href="#use-case" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Use-case&quot;">​</a></h2><p>While Affinity Estimating is commonly used in agile software development, it also finds utility in other domains of business analysis.
