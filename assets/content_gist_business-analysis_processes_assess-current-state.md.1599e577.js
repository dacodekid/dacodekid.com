Other potential areas of investigation include the competitive landscape, specific products, and many more. Factors to be inspected can be as intrinsic as organizational culture, processes, and structure or as extensive as external elements, enterprise architectures, capacities like human resources, and capital resources.</p><h3 id="depth-of-analysis" tabindex="-1">Depth of Analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#depth-of-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Depth of Analysis&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The information gathered during this process is often denser and more detailed than the initial data accumulated while identifying the problem or opportunity. The reason for this is the continuous elicitation activities that further nurture the available information. This process often goes hand-in-hand with the &quot;Conduct Elicitation&quot; section.</p><h3 id="evaluation-of-current-capabilities" tabindex="-1">Evaluation of Current Capabilities <a class="header-anchor" href="#evaluation-of-current-capabilities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Evaluation of Current Capabilities&quot;">​</a></h3><p>One of the principal areas of concentration during the current state assessment is evaluating the organization&#39;s existing capabilities. Here, capability refers to the organization&#39;s proficiency, whether it&#39;s a service, process, or any other function. These capabilities act as the catalyst enabling the organization to realize its strategy. The root cause analysis of an issue lets the organization pinpoint the necessary capabilities or those needing further maturation to cater to the business needs. Any potential limitations and the respective root causes are also identified, and the required capabilities to address these are taken into account.</p><h3 id="objective" tabindex="-1">Objective <a class="header-anchor" href="#objective" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objective&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The primary goal of the current state assessments isn&#39;t to dive deep into a comprehensive analysis of requirements.

A potential pitfall to avoid is straying into areas that might be irrelevant or not beneficial for defining the future state. It&#39;s noteworthy that in instances where a recent detailed assessment of the current state exists, this knowledge can serve as a foundation for the future state without redoing the current state assessment.
