The tool acts as a centralized repository where requirements are logged along with their status, any associated attribute values, and related models. This repository can potentially house the contents of a requirements package, particularly depending on the approach taken for the project life cycle.</p><h2 id="functionalities" tabindex="-1">Functionalities <a class="header-anchor" href="#functionalities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Functionalities&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Requirements Management Tools typically offer a variety of functionalities aimed at streamlining the requirements management process:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Audit Trails and Version Control</strong>: These features support change management by maintaining a history of alterations made to the requirements, who made them, and when they were made.</p></li><li><p><strong>Workflow Functionality</strong>: The tool usually supports the review and approval processes, often by enabling a workflow that can route the requirements to the appropriate stakeholders for review and sign-off.</p></li><li><p><strong>Visual Models and Prototypes</strong>: Certain tools have built-in capabilities for generating visual models or interactive prototypes that can facilitate a deeper understanding of the requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Team Collaboration</strong>: They often include features that enable team members to collaborate within the tool itself, sometimes integrating with other communication tools or platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Office Productivity Integration</strong>: These tools commonly offer integration with office productivity software (like MS Office), making it easier to import/export data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Status Tracking and Reporting</strong>: The tool often allows for tracking the status of individual requirements and may generate reports summarizing the status of all requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traceability</strong>: The tool generally provides functionalities to establish and track trace links between requirements, test cases, source code, and other artifacts.</p></li></ul><p>In the context of adaptive projects, additional features might be included such as the ability to manage product and iteration backlogs and to generate product burndown charts.</p><h2 id="limitations" tabindex="-1">Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Limitations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It&#39;s crucial to note that a Requirements Management Tool in itself does not contribute to the definition of high-quality product information.
