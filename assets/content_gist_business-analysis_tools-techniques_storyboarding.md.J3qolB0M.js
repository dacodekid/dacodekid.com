It is often employed in the early stages of development to aid in requirements elicitation, design brainstorming, and stakeholder communication. It is most effective when used in conjunction with other techniques and tools, like use cases or wireframes, to provide a comprehensive view of the system’s functional and interaction design.</p><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1">Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2>',14);function d(c,u,h,p,g,m){const e=i("QuizJS");return a(),s("div",null,[l,n(e,{quizData:[{id:7083,question:"As a Business Analyst involved in a new mobile app project, you decide to use Storyboarding to illustrate the app's user journey.
