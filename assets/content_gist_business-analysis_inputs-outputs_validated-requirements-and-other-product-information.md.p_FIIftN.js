It is important to note that having validated requirements doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they are well-written or meet project standards.

Validation ensures that &#39;you built the right thing,&#39; while verification ensures that &#39;you built it right.&#39;</p></li></ol><p>Although both verification and validation can happen in any sequence, they often occur in tandem. Once both processes are complete, the validated and verified requirements are then presented to stakeholders for further review and approval.</p><h3 id="stakeholder-agreement" tabindex="-1">Stakeholder Agreement <a class="header-anchor" href="#stakeholder-agreement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stakeholder Agreement&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The validation process involves stakeholder agreement, ensuring that the requirements and product information align with business goals and objectives.
