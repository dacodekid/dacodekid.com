Its prime advantage lies in yielding valuable insights regarding stakeholders. These insights are pivotal in:</p><ul><li>Opting for the right elicitation and analysis techniques.</li><li>Deciding the suitable stakeholders to involve during different phases of business analysis efforts.</li><li>Deciding on the most effective methods of communication and collaboration.</li></ul><p>Stakeholder analysis delves deep into a systematic examination of both quantitative and qualitative details to comprehend stakeholder attributes and ascertain their interests and positions concerning the solution. Carrying out this analysis during the planning phase aids the product team in recognizing how stakeholders can impact or influence the business analysis process from an early stage. The results of this analysis guide the formulation of effective strategies to engage and communicate with stakeholders throughout the project, especially during activities related to requirements.</p><p>An iterative approach is adopted for stakeholder analysis, ensuring it remains relevant and updated throughout the project. As stakeholders&#39; attributes or relationships undergo change or new stakeholders come into the picture, revisiting the analysis becomes crucial. Tweaks in the product scope can lead to the inclusion or exclusion of stakeholders. Although the preliminary planning phase results in an initial list of stakeholders, continuous identification ensures its upkeep. If a vast number of stakeholders emerge, the analysis might lean towards classifying them based on shared characteristics, making the analysis more efficient.</p><h3 id="characteristics" tabindex="-1">Characteristics <a class="header-anchor" href="#characteristics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Characteristics&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Various can be scrutinized during the stakeholder analysis to gain more profound insights about them:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Attitude</strong>: It determines who is supportive, interested, or inclined to back the task and endorse the proposed solution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experience</strong>: It offers insights about the stakeholder&#39;s familiarity concerning the industry, the organization, and the proposed solution, which they can contribute to the team during the business analysis process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interests</strong>: This aspect discerns stakeholders who might experience positive or negative outcomes from the solution.

This process also involves deciding on the roles, responsibilities, and necessary skill sets for tasks essential to the successful completion of the business analysis work.</p><p>The outcome of this process culminates in a business analysis plan. This plan can either be formally documented and approved or less structured, depending on the team&#39;s modus operandi. Regardless of the documentation style, the outcomes from all planning processes should be taken into account in the overarching strategy. Not making planning decisions can potentially lead to suboptimal results during business analysis.

For instance, projects that follow an adaptive life cycle will have a distinct plan for the depth and frequency of analysis activities than those following a predictive life cycle. Offering reasons for planning decisions not only gives context to those assessing the plan but also rationalizes the choices made.</p><p>In a predictive life cycle, a plan-driven approach is often adopted for planning and estimation. Estimations are crafted for each role participating in a project, either for the whole project duration or for specific phases. The granularity of these estimates can vary. In the realm of business analysis, this means individual time estimates are generated for the expected effort for each specific business analysis task. After estimating the tasks, they&#39;re organized into a fitting work plan.</p><p>In contrast, teams that use a change-driven, adaptive life cycle still consider business analysis tasks, effort levels, task durations, dependencies, constraints, and task sequencing. However, usually, business analysis effort and tasks aren&#39;t segregated for estimation and planning.</p><p>For an adaptive life cycle method, during a planning session at the release level, prioritization often emerges as the key planning criterion. When planning starts at the outset of every iteration, both prioritization and just-in-time estimating determine the product backlog items the team will commit to. Post this, these items are split into tasks. Some adaptive approach teams also segregate and estimate time for refining significant or intricate items that are part of the current iteration or are up next in a product backlog but haven&#39;t been fully understood to kickstart development.</p><p>Despite the distinctions in approaches, business analysis planning remains an integral part of product development, regardless of the life cycle model adopted. The act of planning for business analysis must always transpire.</p><h3 id="inputs-2" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="business-analysis-performance-assessment" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Business Analysis Performance Assessment</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#business-analysis-performance-assessment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Business Analysis Performance Assessment](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Business Analysis Performance Assessment evaluates the efficiency and effectiveness of business analysis practices within an organization.

This process primarily centers on how performance will be gauged, the frequency of such evaluations, the timeline of these evaluations, and the individuals responsible for conducting them.</p><p>A significant advantage of this process is its ability to select or devise appropriate performance indicators and metrics. These metrics can then be systematically gathered, reported, and reviewed to enhance the organization and/or product continually.</p><p>The approach for Solution Evaluation requires a combination of thorough research, meaningful discussions, and in-depth analysis. The primary objective is to discern the optimal ways and timelines to assess a product. The key components that should be considered when determining the solution evaluation approach include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Frequency of Evaluation:</strong> It&#39;s essential to strategize when and how often the solution evaluation activities will be executed. This evaluation can be integrated at various stages such as during the solution&#39;s development, immediately before its release, shortly after its launch, or even a considerable time post-launch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selection of Techniques:</strong> It&#39;s not mandatory to finalize all evaluation techniques at the onset. However, a proactive approach ensures that business analysts are equipped and ready to employ a diverse range of techniques as and when required.</p></li><li><p><strong>Analysis and Reporting:</strong> Deliberate planning is needed for how the outcomes of the evaluation will be scrutinized and presented.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication Strategy:</strong> It&#39;s crucial to devise a communication strategy for updating stakeholders and other interested entities about the progress of the solution evaluation. This includes deciding on the degree of formality for such communications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Metrics Selection:</strong> Deciding on the specific metrics that will assess performance is crucial. These metrics should ideally align with the overarching business goals and objectives.</p></li></ul><p>Metrics play a central role in this process. They are essentially sets of quantifiable measures designed to evaluate various aspects of a solution or business. Within the domain of solution evaluation, metrics furnish a framework to measure solution performance. A multitude of metrics can be employed to gauge tangible attributes of the solution, such as its throughput, productivity, or efficiency.</p><p>Typically, there are two prevalent categories of metrics delineated by the solution evaluation approach:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Acceptance Metrics:</strong> These metrics are employed to evaluate the solution or its individual components for acceptance during its developmental phase or shortly after. These metrics work within the confines of pre-defined acceptance criteria that establish permissible ranges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value Metrics:</strong> These metrics are typically deployed at a later stage to discern if the anticipated business value has been realized. Since the assessment of solution performance is delayed till post-release, there&#39;s a possibility that the selected metrics or their measurement methodology might evolve.</p></li></ol><p>For an effective solution evaluation approach, teams should deliberate on several key aspects regarding metrics:</p><ul><li><p>The specific performance data needed for the metrics, its collection frequency, and methodology.</p></li><li><p>The individuals or teams accountable for amassing and presenting this performance data.</p></li><li><p>Existing mechanisms for data collection and reporting for these metrics. If absent, identification of additional required capabilities and the associated financial implications.</p></li></ul><p>The foundational knowledge about the problem or opportunity the solution intends to address and the defined product scope can guide the selection of suitable metrics. Existing industry or organizational standards might offer benchmarks to juxtapose the solution against general expectations.</p><p>It&#39;s paramount to define the solution evaluation approach early in the product development life cycle. An early definition can preempt potential challenges, especially concerning metrics that might need additional data beyond the product&#39;s innate requirements. Delayed definitions could lead to escalated costs or the infeasibility of data acquisition. In cases where proposed metrics prove to be exorbitantly costly or time-intensive, more cost-effective alternatives might be explored.</p><h3 id="inputs-6" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs-6" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="metrics-and-kpis" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Metrics and KPIs</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#metrics-and-kpis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Metrics and KPIs](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Metrics and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are quantifiable measures used to evaluate and track the success or performance of specific business processes or goals.
