This technique is embedded within the Elicitation and Collaboration knowledge area, designed to facilitate deeper understanding and engagement with stakeholders in order to accurately define the root cause of a problem.</p><h3 id="objective" tabindex="-1">Objective <a class="header-anchor" href="#objective" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objective&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The main objective of this technique is to peel away the layers of symptoms which could cloud the root cause of a problem. It assists business analysts in moving past symptoms to understand the underlying cause, thereby aligning proposed solutions more closely with actual business needs.</p><h3 id="methodology" tabindex="-1">Methodology <a class="header-anchor" href="#methodology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Methodology&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Identify the Problem</strong>: Clearly state the problem that you&#39;re trying to solve. This becomes the starting point of the Five-Whys technique.</p></li><li><p><strong>First Level of &quot;Why&quot;</strong>: Ask why the problem occurs. Document this first cause.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subsequent Levels of &quot;Why&quot;</strong>: For the first cause identified, ask “Why?” again to find the underlying cause of that first cause. Repeat this process for each new cause identified until you reach the root cause of the problem. Typically, this is achieved after five rounds, but the number of rounds can vary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid Defensive Responses</strong>: While the technique is called the Five-Whys, the term “why” may make some stakeholders defensive. Therefore, phrase the questions in a way that encourages open discussion and exploration without putting the interviewee on the defensive.</p></li></ol><h3 id="when-to-use" tabindex="-1">When to Use <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-to-use" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When to Use&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Five-Whys is particularly useful when you need a quick and straightforward way to identify the root cause of a problem. It is often used in conjunction with other tools like fishbone diagrams to give a comprehensive understanding of an issue.</p><h3 id="limitations" tabindex="-1">Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Limitations&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The technique has some limitations:</p><ul><li>May oversimplify complex problems that have multiple root causes.</li><li>It’s reliant on the expertise and insights of the people involved; thus, the accuracy of the root cause is subject to their knowledge and experience.</li></ul><h3 id="considerations" tabindex="-1">Considerations <a class="header-anchor" href="#considerations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Considerations&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Though it&#39;s a powerful starting point for root cause analysis, the Five-Whys technique is not always exhaustive. It may need to be supplemented by other analysis tools and techniques for a more comprehensive understanding of the problem.</p><p>Five-Whys technique serves as a foundational tool in the business analyst&#39;s toolkit, helping to ensure that solutions are aligned with the actual root causes of problems, rather than merely addressing symptoms. It is a valuable component of the Requirements Life Cycle Management process as it aids in the effective elicitation and management of precise requirements.</p>',14),n=[a];function h(r,l,u,c,d,p){return t(),s("div",null,n)}const y=e(o,[["render",h]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
