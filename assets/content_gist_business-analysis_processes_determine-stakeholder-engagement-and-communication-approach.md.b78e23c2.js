While overlaps are present, the emphasis differs among the roles. Business analysts concentrate on engagement during product development, whereas the other roles focus on their specific domains.</p><p>Business analysts must collaborate with portfolio, program, and project managers to identify the stakeholders, determine their engagement level, and steer clear of redundancies in communication. Moreover, business analysts may depend on or cooperate with these managers to obtain the required commitment from stakeholders.</p><h3 id="engagement-communication-formality" tabindex="-1">Engagement &amp; Communication Formality <a class="header-anchor" href="#engagement-communication-formality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Engagement &amp; Communication Formality&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Engaging and communicating with stakeholders can range from being highly formal to very informal. In organizations that lean towards formality, this approach becomes a part of a structured business analysis plan. In contrast, adaptive life cycle efforts inherently have &#39;planning communication&#39; built into them, eliminating the need for a formal activity.</p><p>Regardless of the formality level, the thought process behind this engagement and communication is paramount for effective product development. If overlooked, stakeholder involvement might become irregular, risking insufficient engagement for elicitation, analysis, decision-making, and potential misrepresentation of stakeholder interests. Additionally, if stakeholder communication preferences aren&#39;t regarded, it can negatively influence solution choices and their development.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="situation-statement" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Situation Statement</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#situation-statement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Situation Statement](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Situation Statement is a concise description of a problem or an opportunity.
