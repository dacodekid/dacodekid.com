These criteria can be both qualitative and quantitative and may include aspects like:</p><ul><li>Technical capability</li><li>Cost-effectiveness</li><li>Alignment with business goals and objectives</li><li>Quality and reliability of products or services</li><li>Vendor reputation and financial stability</li><li>Customer support and maintenance services</li><li>Compliance with standards and regulations</li><li>Scalability and future-proofing</li></ul><p>These criteria can also be prioritized or weighted based on the importance of each factor in the context of the project or business objectives.</p><h2 id="types-of-criteria" tabindex="-1">Types of Criteria <a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-criteria" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Types of Criteria&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Quantitative Criteria</strong>: These are measurable factors such as cost, speed, and efficiency.
