Unlike absolute estimation methods, which assign a specific unit of time or cost to tasks, relative estimation operates by comparing tasks to each other.</p><h2 id="core-concepts" tabindex="-1">Core Concepts <a class="header-anchor" href="#core-concepts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Core Concepts&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Benchmarking</strong>: Initially, a team selects one or more benchmark items that everyone understands well. These benchmarks serve as a reference point against which other items are compared.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comparison</strong>: New backlog items are compared to these benchmarks to determine their relative size or complexity. They might be considered &#39;twice as complex&#39; or &#39;half as complex&#39; as the benchmark.</p></li><li><p><strong>Units</strong>: The units used in relative estimation are often arbitrary (e.g., story points, t-shirt sizes) and are valuable only when used for comparison within the same project or team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Team Agreement</strong>: The team collectively agrees on the estimates, often through techniques such as Planning Poker, to arrive at a consensus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refinement</strong>: As more is learned about the work or as actual data becomes available, estimates may be revisited and revised.</p></li></ol><h2 id="how-it-differs-from-analogous-estimation" tabindex="-1">How It Differs from Analogous Estimation <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-differs-from-analogous-estimation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How It Differs from Analogous Estimation&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Analogous Estimation</strong>: Primarily relies on historical data from past similar projects. It&#39;s often a top-down estimation method and usually expressed in absolute units like days or dollars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relative Estimation</strong>: Does not necessarily require historical data and is typically a bottom-up estimation technique.
