This process aids in ensuring that the product scope remains accurate and all components are interlinked effectively.</p><h3 id="progressive-elaboration" tabindex="-1">Progressive Elaboration <a class="header-anchor" href="#progressive-elaboration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Progressive Elaboration&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As details of the product become more refined over time, relationships and dependencies evolve as well.

It ensures that as product details are expanded upon and moved through different stages (like building, testing, and implementation), no essential information is missed or omitted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Impact Analysis</strong>: When modifications are proposed or implemented, these linkages provide a full perspective on the associated components that might also need adjustments. This understanding makes change management smoother.</p></li><li><p><strong>Release Decisions</strong>: The interconnections and dependencies among product information play a pivotal role in making informed decisions regarding releases. By understanding how different elements relate, and the value or benefits they bring, one can make more strategic choices about what to implement or release at specific times.</p></li></ol><p>The process of establishing relationships and dependencies is paramount for maintaining a coherent and effective product scope. It ensures that every component of product information aligns with the business goals, is relevant, and that potential changes are managed efficiently.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="product-scope" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Product Scope</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#product-scope" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Product scope provides a high-level overview of the product&#39;s features, functionalities, and boundaries.
