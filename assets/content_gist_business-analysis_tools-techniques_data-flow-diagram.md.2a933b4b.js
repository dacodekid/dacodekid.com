It delineates the sources, transformations, and destinations of data. Here are its core components:</p><h3 id="components" tabindex="-1">Components: <a class="header-anchor" href="#components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Components:&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>External Entities</strong>: These are the actors or systems that interact with the process but lie outside the defined system&#39;s boundary. They are generally represented as boxes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Processes</strong>: Indicated typically by circles, these are the functional units that transform incoming data flow into outgoing data flow. They describe what the system does with the data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Stores</strong>: Represented as two parallel lines, these indicate where data gets stored. It could be a database, a physical storage, or an electronic storage medium.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Flow</strong>: Arrows show the direction of data movement. They can indicate data moving to and from processes, data stores, and external entities.</p></li></ol><h3 id="usage" tabindex="-1">Usage: <a class="header-anchor" href="#usage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Usage:&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>Data Flow Diagrams are typically developed during the analysis phase after initial models like Entity Relationship Diagrams and process flows have been established.</p></li><li><p>The diagram helps to understand the flow of data between systems and actors and is particularly useful for visualizing data inputs and outputs for each process involved.</p></li><li><p>It does not indicate the timing, sequence, or the control factors affecting the data flow, only the stateless flow of data itself.</p></li></ul><h3 id="relationship-to-requirements" tabindex="-1">Relationship to Requirements: <a class="header-anchor" href="#relationship-to-requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relationship to Requirements:&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>The diagram is not usually used as a stand-alone requirements document but rather complements the requirements by providing a visual representation of data movements, which helps in understanding how the requirements will be fulfilled.</p></li><li><p>The business data objects and processes shown in the DFD can be traced back to the requirements. It serves as a helpful tool to stakeholders and developers for understanding how data requirements are met and how data flows through the system.</p></li><li><p>This contextual understanding leads to the identification of specific data requirements and constraints, thereby facilitating a more nuanced and complete requirements gathering process.</p></li></ul><p>By using a Data Flow Diagram, you can provide all stakeholders, including both technical and business team members, with a clear, unambiguous representation of how data moves within the system. This aids not only in requirements gathering but also in the design and implementation phases.</p>',9),o=[n];function r(l,d,h,c,u,m){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const f=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
