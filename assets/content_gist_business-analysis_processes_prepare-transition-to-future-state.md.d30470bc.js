This transition integrates the solution or a component of the solution into the daily operations of the organization. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the organization can embrace the changes arising from the solution&#39;s implementation and that any benefits from the solution can be sustained once it&#39;s operational.</p><h3 id="key-points" tabindex="-1">Key Points <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-points" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Points&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p><ul><li>Ensures that the organization effectively adopts the changes from the new solution.</li><li>Ensures anticipated benefits from the solution can be sustained post-implementation.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Transition Readiness Assessment</strong>:</p><ul><li>Evaluates an organization&#39;s capability and willingness to operate within the future state.</li><li>Identifies readiness gaps, which are seen as risks to achieving the desired end state.</li><li>Incorporates results from an organizational readiness assessment, considering influences of the organization&#39;s EEFs (Environmental Enterprise Factors) and OPA (Organizational Process Assets).</li><li>An organization&#39;s readiness can be compared against a maturity model or against similar organizations for insights into competitive opportunities or challenges.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Transition Requirements</strong>:</p><ul><li>These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and training requirements.</li><li>They also detail operational changes required to move from the current to the future state.</li><li>Such requirements can emerge from modeling, defining product requirements, or feasibility analysis.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Transition Strategies</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Massive One-time Cutover</strong>: Direct transition to the future state all at once.</li><li><strong>Staged Release</strong>: Gradual release of the future state based on target segments, like region or type of customer.</li><li><strong>Time-boxed Coexistence</strong>: Both current and future states coexist for a set period before a final cutover.</li><li><strong>Permanent Coexistence</strong>: Both states continue to coexist indefinitely.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Transition Plan</strong>:</p><ul><li>Created collaboratively with all roles responsible for the transition.</li><li>Addresses all transition requirements, including communication, rollout, training, and updates to procedures.</li><li>Is coordinated with other releases that contribute to the future state.</li><li>Ensures the business can handle changes, including interruptions caused by the transition.</li><li>Can be adjusted to cater to emerging transition requirements or readiness deficiencies.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Considerations for Successful Transition</strong>:</p><ul><li>Ensure the solution delivers expected capabilities.</li><li>Prepare users for the change.</li><li>Operational environments may need setup or conversion, especially for complex products or large user bases.</li><li>A well-considered and executed transition plan is vital for success.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Organizational Approaches</strong>:</p><ul><li>Large organizations with predictive life cycles often have a structured approach to transitions.</li><li>Whether using predictive or adaptive life cycles, rigor, discipline, and sometimes automation are crucial for a smooth transition.</li><li>Transition plans should ideally be considered early in a product&#39;s life cycle.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In summary, preparing for a transition to the future state is a meticulous process that demands thorough planning and collaboration. It&#39;s about assessing and ensuring that an organization is not only ready to adopt a new solution but also capable of sustaining its benefits in the long run. Whether through a one-time cutover or a staged approach, the transition must be managed with precision to ensure long-term success.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="business-case" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Business Case</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#business-case" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Business Case](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Business Case is a critical input that encapsulates the justification for initiating a project or task.
