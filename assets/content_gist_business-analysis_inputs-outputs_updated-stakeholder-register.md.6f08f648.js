This document serves as a central repository for storing information about the stakeholders who have an interest or involvement in the project or product. Maintaining an up-to-date stakeholder register is pivotal to successful business analysis, as any oversight can lead to the loss of crucial product requirements.</p><h3 id="key-components" tabindex="-1">Key Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Components&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Names</strong>: One of the primary updates in this register is the addition or modification of stakeholder names.
