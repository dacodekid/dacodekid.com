As the business analysis progresses, the business analyst might discover additional linkages. This identification is often performed in conjunction with the specific process described in Section 8.2, which deals explicitly with establishing relationships and dependencies.</p><p>&quot;Relationships and Dependencies&quot; serve as the architectural framework for managing requirements effectively. They enable business analysts to take a holistic view, considering the myriad ways in which different elements interconnect, thereby contributing to more informed decision-making and better project outcomes.</p>',9),o=[a];function r(l,d,c,p,h,u){return n(),s("div",null,o)}const g=e(t,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
