Approved requirements lead to the creation of the requirements baseline, a crucial boundary that encompasses all sanctioned requirements pertaining to various facets like the solution, project phase, release, iteration, and others.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Predictive Life Cycle</strong>: In this lifecycle, once the baseline is set, alterations can only materialize through the stipulated change management procedures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptive Life Cycle</strong>: In this lifecycle, requirements get their baseline status once they are tagged for the upcoming or later iterations. Changes here are permissible only if there&#39;s mutual team agreement or if the product owner chooses to halt the user story, task, or potentially the entire iteration. If user stories or tasks are halted, they either return to the product backlog for later assessment or get marked as redundant.</p></li></ul><h3 id="modalities-of-approval" tabindex="-1">Modalities of Approval <a class="header-anchor" href="#modalities-of-approval" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Modalities of Approval&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The approval process can differ based on the organizational structure or the nature of the project.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Formal Approval</strong>: Some entities mandate an official sign-off, for instance, on a business requirements document.</p></li><li><p><strong>Informal Approval</strong>: Certain projects or organizations might be content with a verbal nod for requirement approval.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptive Projects Approval</strong>: For adaptive projects, approved requirements might be symbolized by a backlog list primed for development or could be the aftermath of iteration planning.</p></li></ul><h3 id="achieving-consensus-on-requirements" tabindex="-1">Achieving Consensus on Requirements <a class="header-anchor" href="#achieving-consensus-on-requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Achieving Consensus on Requirements&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Given the importance of the requirements, it&#39;s imperative that authorized stakeholders achieve a consensus on their accuracy and completeness. Discrepancies in requirements are not rare. Achieving consensus often entails negotiation. The role of business analysis here is to mediate stakeholder discussions, harmonizing varying perspectives, resolving requirement conflicts, and orchestrating a collectively agreed conclusion leading to approval.</p><p>Tracking approvals is essential, and in scenarios where stakeholders exhibit reluctance to give their approval, it&#39;s crucial to delve into their reservations and address them. The green light for further work largely depends on the requirement&#39;s endorsement. If a mutual consensus is elusive within the team, then the stipulations laid out in the stakeholder engagement approach, which details the hierarchical authority concerning requirement approval, come into play.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="product-scope" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Product Scope</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#product-scope" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The product scope encompasses the features, functions, and characteristics of the final product or solution.
