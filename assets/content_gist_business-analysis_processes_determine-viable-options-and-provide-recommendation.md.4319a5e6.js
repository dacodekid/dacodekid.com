This process serves to confirm the practicability of the suggested solutions and offer the optimal path for the leadership to achieve the business targets.</p><p>To determine feasible options, dialogues are held with stakeholders and the product team. The aim is to delineate a series of potential solution recommendations that can cater to the business requirement. The options devised are based on the insights gathered from both current and future state analyses. A solution approach is then defined for each option, which gives a broad overview of the considerations and necessary steps to deliver the solution and facilitate the transition from the current to the envisioned future state.</p><p>A common oversight by stakeholders is to suggest solutions without a thorough grasp of the situation&#39;s intricacies. Demonstrating the outcome of needs analysis to decision-makers and elucidating why certain options are preferred can mitigate the risk of selecting an inappropriate solution.</p><h3 id="key-activities" tabindex="-1">Key activities <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-activities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key activities&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Identifying viable options:</strong> Drawing from the current and future state analyses to discern the most fitting solution choices for the business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conducting feasibility analysis:</strong> This involves evaluating multiple elements to determine the practicability of the options being considered. Some elements include:</p><ul><li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Limitations that may hinder the option.</li><li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Factors presumed to be true without concrete evidence.</li><li><strong>Product risks:</strong> Uncertainties that may influence the successful solution delivery.</li><li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> Relationships that a solution relies on for successful execution.</li><li><strong>Culture:</strong> Organizational factors that can influence both the success of the business analysis and the portfolio, program, or project.</li><li><strong>Operational feasibility:</strong> How receptive the organization is to the change and its sustainability post-implementation.</li><li><strong>Technology feasibility:</strong> The availability or accessibility of requisite technology and technical skills.</li><li><strong>Supportability:</strong> How easily an option can be sustained and managed over time.</li><li><strong>Cost-effectiveness feasibility:</strong> A preliminary cost and benefit estimation.</li><li><strong>Time feasibility:</strong> Whether the solution can be realized within set time frames.</li><li><strong>Value:</strong> The business value the solution brings.</li><li><strong>Validation:</strong> Assurance of solution alignment with business objectives.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Defining preliminary product scope:</strong> Outlining the capabilities each option will deliver at a higher level.</p></li><li><p><strong>Defining high-level transition requirements:</strong> Identifying considerations like data migration or training needs for transitioning to the specified solution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recommending the most viable option:</strong> If multiple options remain post-feasibility analysis, one is chosen as the most viable. This is accompanied by a rationale, highlighting the reasons for its selection over other options.</p></li></ol><p>If post-analysis only one option emerges as feasible, it&#39;s typically recommended. If no options are feasible, a recommendation might be to take no action. If there are multiple viable options, they can be ranked based on their alignment with the business need. Weighted ranking can be an effective technique for this analysis.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="business-goals-and-objectives" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Business Goals and Objectives</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#business-goals-and-objectives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Business Goals and Objectives](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Business goals and objectives are the foundational elements in determining viable options and providing recommendations.
