After estimating these lower-level tasks, the estimates are then aggregated to provide a total estimate for the project or larger work package. This approach often relies on a decomposition model to identify these lower-level tasks.</p><h3 id="overview" tabindex="-1">Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Overview&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In Bottom-Up Estimating, the idea is <mark>to dissect the larger</mark> work package or project scope <mark>into smaller, more manageable tasks</mark>. These tasks are then estimated in terms of duration, resources, or cost. Once all lower-level estimates are made, they are summed up to produce the overall project estimate. The accuracy of Bottom-Up Estimating is generally higher compared to other techniques like top-down estimating, particularly because it focuses on detailed analysis.</p><h3 id="process-and-methodology" tabindex="-1">Process and Methodology <a class="header-anchor" href="#process-and-methodology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Process and Methodology&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Decomposition</strong>: The first step is to break down the larger work package or project scope into smaller, individual tasks or components.

It can be applied to estimate the effort required for business analysis activities, the development of business requirements, or even for evaluating the total cost of implementing a solution.</p><p>Bottom-Up Estimating aligns well with the Business Analysis core concept model, as it encourages a detailed understanding of the requirements, facilitating effective stakeholder collaboration and ensuring that the solution meets the business needs efficiently.</p>',13),n=[o];function r(l,c,m,d,h,p){return t(),s("div",null,n)}const f=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
