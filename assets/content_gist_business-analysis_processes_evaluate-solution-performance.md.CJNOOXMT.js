This process holds importance because it provides empirical data that helps in determining if the solution in which the business has invested is meeting the expected business outcomes. It also aids in making decisions about future projects or initiatives.</p><h2 id="objective" tabindex="-1">Objective <a class="header-anchor" href="#objective" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objective&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The main aim is to ascertain if a solution or its part, after being operationalized, is producing the desired business value. This value is usually gauged in reference to the business goals or objectives. Moreover, business analysis delves into understanding the underlying reasons for the obtained results.</p><h2 id="when-is-it-conducted" tabindex="-1">When is it Conducted? <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-is-it-conducted" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When is it Conducted?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Although the evaluation of solution performance typically takes place post the release of a solution, it isn&#39;t limited to that timeframe. It is more probable for this evaluation to happen during portfolio or program phases as opposed to during project phases. The magnitude of achieved business value and the reasons for such an accomplishment play a crucial role when making product-related decisions within a portfolio or program. However, this evaluation process can also be utilized during a project whenever it can offer insights.</p><h2 id="data-collection" tabindex="-1">Data Collection <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-collection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data Collection&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The data required to assess business value is mostly procured from the business sector responsible for the solution or through instrumentation integrated into the product itself. Business analysis methods play a pivotal role in analyzing the discrepancies between anticipated and actual outcomes, crucial for determining the business value of the solution. Since many business value measurements are required post the release of a solution and often span over an extended period to identify patterns, there&#39;s a necessity for organizational dedication towards both these measurements and investing in tools required for these measurements. If such investments aren&#39;t feasible, organizations might opt for alternative, cost-effective methods to measure business value. In some cases, substitutes or proxies for business value can be utilized.</p><h2 id="analysis" tabindex="-1">Analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Analysis&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To ascertain if value has been delivered, various elements like relevant business goals and objectives, evaluated acceptance results from prior releases, performance data, and available baseline data are analyzed. Furthermore, the reasons behind exceeding expectations or understanding the core issues are also assessed. Typical reasons for not achieving anticipated business value encompass:</p><ul><li>Technical reasons.</li><li>Business protocols or restrictions.</li><li>Aversion to the product or its intended usage.</li><li>Opportunistic workarounds created by users to bypass actual or assumed solution constraints.</li></ul><h2 id="outcome" tabindex="-1">Outcome <a class="header-anchor" href="#outcome" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Outcome&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The evaluation of a product&#39;s performance acts as a recommendation for ameliorating the long-term efficacy of the solutions.
