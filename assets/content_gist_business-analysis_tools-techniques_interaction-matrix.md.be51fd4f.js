Unlike a traceability matrix, which is a living document that evolves over the course of a project, an interaction matrix is not maintained over time. It is utilized to evaluate whether requirements are adequately detailed and to identify any missing entities.</p><p>In the structure of the Interaction Matrix:</p><ul><li>Rows represent one category of product information, such as use cases, user stories, or process flows.</li><li>Columns represent another category of product information, like data entities, business rules, or user interfaces.</li></ul><p>To populate the matrix, an &quot;X&quot; is placed at the intersection where the product information in a row uses or references the product information in a corresponding column. This enables quick visualization of the relationships and dependencies between different elements.</p><h3 id="example" tabindex="-1">Example <a class="header-anchor" href="#example" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example&quot;">​</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th>REQID</th><th>Requirement</th><th>Entity A</th><th>Entity B</th><th>Entity C</th><th>Entity D</th><th>Entity E</th><th>Column 1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>REQ-001</td><td>Login User</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td>X</td><td></td><td>Data</td></tr><tr><td>REQ-002</td><td>Create Account</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td>Data</td></tr><tr><td>REQ-003</td><td>Update Profile</td><td></td><td></td><td>X</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>Data</td></tr><tr><td>REQ-004</td><td>Delete Account</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Data</td></tr><tr><td>REQ-005</td><td>Search Products</td><td></td><td>X</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Data</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In this sample interaction matrix:</p><ul><li>REQID is the unique identifier for each requirement.</li><li>&quot;Requirement&quot; describes the functional or non-functional requirement.</li><li>Entities A, B, C, D, and E represent different types of product information, such as data entities, business rules, or user interfaces.</li><li>An &#39;X&#39; is placed in the matrix where the requirement (row) uses the entity (column).</li><li>&quot;Column 1&quot; could be used for additional information or notes.</li></ul><p>This interaction matrix is useful for evaluating the relationships between different requirements and entities at a specific point in time.
