It helps to recognize where each function performs one of the CRUD operations on a particular entity. This can be essential for understanding system behavior and for specifying requirements for a system.</p><p>Here&#39;s a sample CRUD Matrix with some example data:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Functionality / Data Object</th><th>Customer</th><th>Product</th><th>Order</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Add Customer</td><td>C</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>View Customer</td><td>R</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Update Customer</td><td>U</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Delete Customer</td><td>D</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>List Products</td><td></td><td>R</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Add Product</td><td></td><td>C</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Update Product</td><td></td><td>U</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Remove Product</td><td></td><td>D</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Create Order</td><td></td><td></td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>View Order</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td></tr><tr><td>Update Order</td><td></td><td></td><td>U</td></tr><tr><td>Cancel Order</td><td></td><td></td><td>D</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In this matrix:</p><ul><li>Columns represent data objects like &quot;Customer,&quot; &quot;Product,&quot; and &quot;Order.&quot;</li><li>Rows signify different functionalities such as &quot;Add Customer,&quot; &quot;View Customer,&quot; etc.</li></ul><p>The letters (C, R, U, D) indicate which type of operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) each functionality performs on each data object.</p><p>For example, the &quot;Add Customer&quot; functionality Creates a &quot;Customer&quot; (hence the &#39;C&#39; under the &quot;Customer&quot; column). The &quot;View Order&quot; functionality Reads from &quot;Customer,&quot; &quot;Product,&quot; and &quot;Order&quot; (indicated by &#39;R&#39;s in the respective columns).</p><p>This is a simple example, but CRUD Matrices can get much more complex based on the complexity and scope of the system.</p><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1">Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2>',10);function c(u,l,h,f,m,p){const t=a("QuizJS");return i(),n("div",null,[s,r(t,{quizData:[{id:4439,question:"A business analyst is designing a new inventory management system and needs to define how different functionalities interact with various data entities.
