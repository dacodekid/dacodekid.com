These models are instrumental in visually articulating how a particular solution aligns with and aims to achieve the overarching business objectives.</p><p><strong>Goal Models</strong>: These are specifically designed to show stakeholder goals for a particular solution. The model can indicate relationships between different goals, including those that may support or conflict with one another.</p><p><strong>Business Objectives Models</strong>: These models offer a decomposition of high-level business strategies into tangible business problems and objectives. They serve to visually represent the value proposition of a portfolio, program, or project and how a planned solution aims to fulfill these objectives. This could be in terms of increasing revenue, decreasing costs, or avoiding penalties.</p><p>Both Goal Models and Business Objectives Models are typically created at the inception of a program or project. However, they can be revisited and updated at any point, especially for the purpose of prioritization within a portfolio.</p><p><strong>Role in Feature Prioritization and Scope Management</strong>: One of the key functions of these models is to assist in feature prioritization. By laying out the business objectives and goals, these models provide a basis for determining which features are of utmost importance and should be prioritized for development.</p><p><strong>Alignment with Business Objectives</strong>: These models are often used to ensure that the requirements or user stories are in sync with the business objectives. They can act as a traceability matrix to map features or requirements back to specific business goals, thereby ensuring alignment.</p><p><strong>Collaboration with Project Management</strong>: It’s worth noting that the project manager can contribute to the completion of these models, especially if a cost-benefit analysis or business case has already been developed. Information from these analyses can feed into the goal and business objectives models to provide a more comprehensive view.</p><p>By facilitating a structured approach to defining and understanding business goals and objectives, these models are indispensable tools for business analysts in achieving alignment, aiding decision-making, and ensuring that the developed solution adds value to the business.</p><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1">Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2>',10);function c(d,u,h,p,m,b){const e=t("QuizJS");return o(),i("div",null,[l,a(e,{quizData:[{question:"What is the primary purpose of Goal Models and Business Objectives Models in business analysis?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"To manage the organization's social media strategy"},{key:"B",text:"To visually articulate how a solution aligns with business objectives"},{key:"C",text:"To track the individual performance of team members"},{key:"D",text:"To set up the organization's IT infrastructure"}],answer:"B",explanation:"The primary purpose of Goal Models and Business Objectives Models in business analysis is to visually articulate and organize how a particular solution aligns with and aims to achieve the overarching business objectives and goals."},{question:"How do Goal Models and Business Objectives Models assist in feature prioritization?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"By focusing on the aesthetic aspects of features"},{key:"B",text:"By laying out business objectives and goals to determine feature importance"},{key:"C",text:"By determining the project's budget allocation"},{key:"D",text:"By setting up team-building exercises"}],answer:"B",explanation:"Goal Models and Business Objectives Models assist in feature prioritization by laying out the business objectives and goals.
