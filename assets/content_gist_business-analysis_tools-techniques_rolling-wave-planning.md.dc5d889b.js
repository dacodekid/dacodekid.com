In the context of business analysis, this technique has applications in both predictive and adaptive life cycles.</p><h3 id="predictive-life-cycle-context" tabindex="-1">Predictive Life Cycle Context <a class="header-anchor" href="#predictive-life-cycle-context" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Predictive Life Cycle Context&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In a predictive or traditional life cycle, business analysts may work closely with the project manager to develop rolling wave estimates for various business analysis tasks. These estimates would be aligned with the overall project schedule and would focus on detailed planning for near-term tasks while keeping planning for future tasks at a higher level. This allows for greater flexibility in accommodating changes or new information as the project progresses.</p><h3 id="adaptive-life-cycle-context" tabindex="-1">Adaptive Life Cycle Context <a class="header-anchor" href="#adaptive-life-cycle-context" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Adaptive Life Cycle Context&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In an adaptive life cycle, commonly seen in Agile frameworks, rolling wave planning is often employed at the release level. This technique aids in determining the features and functions that will be part of the current or upcoming release. Rather than trying to plan every detail from the start, the planning occurs in &quot;waves&quot; as the project progresses and as more information becomes available.</p><h3 id="role-of-progressive-elaboration" tabindex="-1">Role of Progressive Elaboration <a class="header-anchor" href="#role-of-progressive-elaboration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Role of Progressive Elaboration&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Progressive elaboration, or the gradual detailing of project plans, aligns closely with rolling wave planning. As the project advances, further analysis identifies specific features and epics for inclusion in the current release. New information is continuously incorporated into plans, allowing for a more flexible and adaptive planning process.</p><h3 id="implications-for-business-analysis" tabindex="-1">Implications for Business Analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#implications-for-business-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Implications for Business Analysis&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The business analyst plays a critical role in rolling wave planning. In a predictive life cycle, the business analyst may be responsible for creating or assisting in the creation of detailed plans for near-term business analysis tasks. In an adaptive life cycle, the business analyst could work closely with the product owner and the development team to determine which features, functions, or epics should be prioritized for the upcoming release based on the most current information.</p><p>By employing rolling wave planning, business analysts and project teams can adapt more easily to changes and new information, thereby reducing the risk associated with long-term planning while still maintaining a degree of structure and direction.</p>',11),o=[s];function l(r,c,p,d,h,f){return a(),n("div",null,o)}const m=e(t,[["render",l]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
