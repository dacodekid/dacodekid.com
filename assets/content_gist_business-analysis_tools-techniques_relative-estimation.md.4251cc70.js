Unlike absolute estimation methods, which assign a specific unit of time or cost to tasks, relative estimation operates by comparing tasks to each other.</p><h3 id="core-concepts" tabindex="-1">Core Concepts <a class="header-anchor" href="#core-concepts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Core Concepts&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Benchmarking</strong>: Initially, a team selects one or more benchmark items that everyone understands well. These benchmarks serve as a reference point against which other items are compared.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comparison</strong>: New backlog items are compared to these benchmarks to determine their relative size or complexity. They might be considered &#39;twice as complex&#39; or &#39;half as complex&#39; as the benchmark.</p></li><li><p><strong>Units</strong>: The units used in relative estimation are often arbitrary (e.g., story points, t-shirt sizes) and are valuable only when used for comparison within the same project or team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Team Agreement</strong>: The team collectively agrees on the estimates, often through techniques such as Planning Poker, to arrive at a consensus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refinement</strong>: As more is learned about the work or as actual data becomes available, estimates may be revisited and revised.</p></li></ol><h3 id="how-it-differs-from-analogous-estimation" tabindex="-1">How It Differs from Analogous Estimation <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-differs-from-analogous-estimation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How It Differs from Analogous Estimation&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Analogous Estimation</strong>: Primarily relies on historical data from past similar projects. It&#39;s often a top-down estimation method and usually expressed in absolute units like days or dollars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relative Estimation</strong>: Does not necessarily require historical data and is typically a bottom-up estimation technique. It uses arbitrary units and relies more on team consensus.</p></li></ul><h3 id="benefits" tabindex="-1">Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefits&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Because it doesn&#39;t require detailed analysis or decomposition of tasks, relative estimation is usually faster than other methods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: It accommodates changes more easily, as you only need to reconsider the relative sizes of items, not their absolute estimates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: The method encourages team members to discuss and arrive at a consensus, enhancing team understanding of each item.</p></li><li><p><strong>Less Error-Prone</strong>: By avoiding the complexities associated with deriving absolute values, relative estimation is often less susceptible to major inaccuracies.</p></li></ul><h3 id="limitations" tabindex="-1">Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Limitations&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Calibration</strong>: It might take time for a team to become proficient in estimating relatively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Context-Specific</strong>: The estimates are generally not transferable across different teams or projects as they are context-specific.</p></li></ul><h3 id="applications" tabindex="-1">Applications <a class="header-anchor" href="#applications" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Applications&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>Most commonly used in Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, for product backlog refinement.</p></li><li><p>Useful in environments where the work is complex and the scope is not easily decomposed into detailed components.</p></li></ul><p>In summary, Relative Estimation is an effective technique for quickly estimating tasks or backlog items based on their complexity relative to a known benchmark. It fosters team collaboration and is particularly useful in Agile or rapidly changing environments.</p>',13),n=[o];function r(l,c,m,h,p,d){return t(),i("div",null,n)}const f=e(s,[["render",r]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
