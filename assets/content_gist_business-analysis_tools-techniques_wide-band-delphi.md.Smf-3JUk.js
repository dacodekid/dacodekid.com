This can happen in a face-to-face meeting, virtual conference, or other collaborative forums.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rationale Sharing</strong>: Those who provided the highest and lowest estimates are given an opportunity to share their reasoning. This helps in uncovering hidden assumptions, overlooked risks, or additional context that may affect the estimate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Re-Estimation</strong>: Experts revise their estimates based on the discussion and any new insights gained.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iteration</strong>: The process of summarization, discussion, and re-estimation is repeated until a convergence of estimates is achieved.</p></li></ol><h3 id="advantages" tabindex="-1">Advantages <a class="header-anchor" href="#advantages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Advantages&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Improved Accuracy</strong>: The increased bandwidth of communication allows for better understanding and therefore more accurate estimates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Team Collaboration</strong>: Open discussions enable team members to share insights, reducing the likelihood of overlooking key factors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quick Convergence</strong>: The iterative approach, coupled with open discussions, usually leads to quicker convergence compared to traditional Delphi.</p></li></ul><h3 id="disadvantages" tabindex="-1">Disadvantages <a class="header-anchor" href="#disadvantages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Disadvantages&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Time-Consuming</strong>: Because it involves more discussion, it can be more time-consuming compared to traditional Delphi.</p></li><li><p><strong>Potential for Bias</strong>: The anonymity is compromised to some extent, which may introduce bias or influence from dominant personalities.</p></li></ul><h3 id="applicability" tabindex="-1">Applicability <a class="header-anchor" href="#applicability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Applicability&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Complex Projects</strong>: Useful for tasks that are complex and where initial estimates can vary widely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expert-Led Environments</strong>: Best suited for situations where a variety of experts contribute to the project and their collective wisdom is valued.</p></li><li><p><strong>Agile Methodologies</strong>: It can be effectively integrated into Agile frameworks where iterative estimation and re-estimation are common.</p></li></ul><p>Wide-Band Delphi combines the structured, anonymous input of the Delphi technique with more open communication to arrive at reliable estimates.
