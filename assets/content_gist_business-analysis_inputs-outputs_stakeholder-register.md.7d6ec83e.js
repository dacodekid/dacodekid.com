This could include their stake in the project, their level of authority, and how changes to the project may affect them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Classification</strong>: Stakeholders are categorized based on various factors such as influence, impact, or interest. Classification helps in tailoring communication and engagement strategies for different stakeholder groups.</p></li></ol><h3 id="uses" tabindex="-1">Uses <a class="header-anchor" href="#uses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Uses&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Analysis</strong>: The stakeholder register is a foundational input for performing stakeholder analysis. It helps in understanding the needs and expectations of each stakeholder, which, in turn, aids in better project decision-making.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication Planning</strong>: Information from the register can be used to develop the Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach, as it provides insights into who needs what information and how they should receive it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Understanding who the stakeholders are and what their interests entail can help in identifying potential risks or resistance to the project. Strategies can then be developed to mitigate these risks.</p></li></ul><h3 id="maintenance" tabindex="-1">Maintenance <a class="header-anchor" href="#maintenance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Maintenance&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The stakeholder register is not a static document; it is dynamic and is updated continuously. As the project progresses or the business context changes, new stakeholders may come into the picture, or existing stakeholders&#39; interests or influence may change. Hence, it needs to be maintained actively throughout the lifecycle of business analysis and portfolio, program, and project management activities.</p><p>In summary, the Stakeholder Register is a critical asset that helps teams identify who their stakeholders are, what their interests and influences are, and how they should be engaged and communicated with for the successful completion of a project or implementation of a solution.</p>',9),o=[i];function r(l,h,d,c,p,u){return t(),s("div",null,o)}const f=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
