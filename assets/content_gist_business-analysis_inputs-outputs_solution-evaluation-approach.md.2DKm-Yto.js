These metrics could be quantitative or qualitative and may pertain to various dimensions such as financial performance, user satisfaction, operational efficiency, or market penetration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>: Alongside defining metrics, the solution evaluation approach sets the acceptance criteria, which specify acceptable ranges or boundaries for each metric. These criteria act as a benchmark to evaluate whether the solution is successful or needs modification.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluation Activities</strong>: The approach outlines the activities to be carried out to evaluate the solution, detailing what methods or techniques will be used in the evaluation process. These activities are critical for ensuring a thorough and unbiased assessment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Timeline</strong>: It may specify when the solution will be evaluated. This is particularly important because the effectiveness of a solution may change over time, requiring iterative evaluations.</p></li></ol><h2 id="dynamic-nature" tabindex="-1">Dynamic Nature <a class="header-anchor" href="#dynamic-nature" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Dynamic Nature&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It&#39;s crucial to note that the solution evaluation approach is not a static document but may evolve over time.
