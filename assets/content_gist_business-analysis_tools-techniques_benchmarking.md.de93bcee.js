The primary aim is to identify gaps in performance and gain insights into areas for improvement. Benchmarking is not exclusive to business analysis but is a tool where business analysis skills are essential for interpreting and applying the results.</p><h3 id="relevance-in-business-analysis" tabindex="-1">Relevance in Business Analysis: <a class="header-anchor" href="#relevance-in-business-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relevance in Business Analysis:&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Benchmarking serves multiple purposes in business analysis. From informing the Needs Assessment phase to guiding the formulation of solutions and future state analysis, it provides a data-driven approach to decision-making. It is also adaptable and can be applied to various industries, making it a versatile tool in the business analyst&#39;s toolkit.</p><h2 id="uses-in-different-areas-of-needs-assessment" tabindex="-1">Uses in Different Areas of Needs Assessment: <a class="header-anchor" href="#uses-in-different-areas-of-needs-assessment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Uses in Different Areas of Needs Assessment:&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Understanding the Magnitude of Problem or Opportunity</strong>:</p><ul><li>It aids in gauging the extent of the existing problem or opportunity.</li><li>When internal data is insufficient or cannot be easily collected, benchmarking can provide valuable comparative data.</li><li>By measuring the size of the problem or opportunity, the business analyst can propose appropriately sized solutions.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Future State Analysis</strong>:</p><ul><li>Benchmarking helps in determining new capabilities needed for an organization by comparing it against others who have addressed similar issues or capitalized on similar opportunities.</li><li>It often guides final recommendations and can also point out options that should not be pursued.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Idea Generation for Solution Options</strong>:</p><ul><li>Results from benchmarking can stimulate creative thinking in generating a list of feasible and viable options to solve a problem or seize an opportunity.</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id="methodology" tabindex="-1">Methodology: <a class="header-anchor" href="#methodology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Methodology:&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Identify Benchmark Subject</strong>: Determine what you will benchmark — processes, performance metrics, or practices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Select Benchmarking Partners</strong>: <mark>Choose &quot;best-in-class&quot; organizations within or outside your industry</mark> for the most meaningful comparisons.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collect Data</strong>: Gather relevant data from these organizations.
