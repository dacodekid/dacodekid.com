The decision is typically formalized through a sign-off process, the nature of which varies depending on multiple factors like project type, product type, project life cycle, scale of release, and corporate as well as regulatory constraints.</p><h2 id="accountability-for-sign-off" tabindex="-1">Accountability for Sign-Off <a class="header-anchor" href="#accountability-for-sign-off" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Accountability for Sign-Off&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix, developed during Business Analysis Planning, indicates who holds the accountability for the solution&#39;s sign-off. This ensures that the right stakeholders are involved in making the release decision.</p><h2 id="factors-influencing-sign-off-formality" tabindex="-1">Factors Influencing Sign-Off Formality <a class="header-anchor" href="#factors-influencing-sign-off-formality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Factors Influencing Sign-Off Formality&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Formal sign-offs are more common in scenarios where:</p><ol><li><strong>Broad Impact</strong>: Projects have a line of business-wide or enterprise-wide influence.</li><li><strong>High-Risk Consequences</strong>: Errors or failure could result in severe repercussions like death or financial insolvency.</li><li><strong>Predictive Life Cycles</strong>: Organizations following a strict predictive project life cycle.</li><li><strong>Regulated Industries</strong>: In sectors like banking, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals where regulatory compliance is crucial.</li></ol><h2 id="sign-off-practices" tabindex="-1">Sign-Off Practices <a class="header-anchor" href="#sign-off-practices" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sign-Off Practices&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Organizations should reach a consensus on the format of a sign-off document, the record-keeping practices, storage methods, and the modality of obtaining the sign-off. This could range from handwritten &quot;wet signatures&quot; to electronic signatures or even email confirmations.</p><h2 id="collaboration-point" tabindex="-1">Collaboration Point <a class="header-anchor" href="#collaboration-point" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Collaboration Point&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Project Manager and the Business Analyst collaborate, often with auditing and other project stakeholders, to decide the appropriate sign-off practices for the organization and the specific project.

In contrast, for iterative or adaptive life cycles like Agile, informal sign-offs might happen at the end of each sprint or iteration, culminating in a formal sign-off before the solution is released.</p><p>The Release Decision is not just an authorization but a carefully deliberated conclusion involving various stakeholders.
