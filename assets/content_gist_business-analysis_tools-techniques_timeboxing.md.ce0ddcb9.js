In this technique, a fixed time period, or 'box', is allocated for specific tasks or objectives. Once the time box expires, the work is evaluated regardless of whether it is completed. Timeboxing is particularly useful for controlling scope and ensuring that the project progresses in a timely manner. It helps the team to focus on delivering the highest priority items within a set timeframe.",-1),l=e("p",null,"In the context of business analysis, timeboxing is often used during the prioritization of requirements or tasks. Typically, the timebox serves as a constraint under which the team identifies the most critical work items to complete. This is usually accomplished using a second prioritization scheme, such as MoSCoW (Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves), Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF), or business value points to rank the requirements. Once ranked, only those requirements or tasks that can feasibly be completed within the given timebox are pulled in for implementation.",-1),h=e("p",null,"For example, if a team has a timebox of two weeks (common in Scrum Sprints), they would pull in just enough highest-priority requirements that they believe can be fully implemented in those two weeks.
