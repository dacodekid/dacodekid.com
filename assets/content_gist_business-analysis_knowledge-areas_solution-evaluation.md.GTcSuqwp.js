This process primarily centers on how performance will be gauged, the frequency of such evaluations, the timeline of these evaluations, and the individuals responsible for conducting them.</p><p>A significant advantage of this process is its ability to select or devise appropriate performance indicators and metrics. These metrics can then be systematically gathered, reported, and reviewed to enhance the organization and/or product continually.</p><p>The approach for Solution Evaluation requires a combination of thorough research, meaningful discussions, and in-depth analysis. The primary objective is to discern the optimal ways and timelines to assess a product. The key components that should be considered when determining the solution evaluation approach include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Frequency of Evaluation:</strong> It&#39;s essential to strategize when and how often the solution evaluation activities will be executed. This evaluation can be integrated at various stages such as during the solution&#39;s development, immediately before its release, shortly after its launch, or even a considerable time post-launch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selection of Techniques:</strong> It&#39;s not mandatory to finalize all evaluation techniques at the onset. However, a proactive approach ensures that business analysts are equipped and ready to employ a diverse range of techniques as and when required.</p></li><li><p><strong>Analysis and Reporting:</strong> Deliberate planning is needed for how the outcomes of the evaluation will be scrutinized and presented.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication Strategy:</strong> It&#39;s crucial to devise a communication strategy for updating stakeholders and other interested entities about the progress of the solution evaluation. This includes deciding on the degree of formality for such communications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Metrics Selection:</strong> Deciding on the specific metrics that will assess performance is crucial. These metrics should ideally align with the overarching business goals and objectives.</p></li></ul><p>Metrics play a central role in this process. They are essentially sets of quantifiable measures designed to evaluate various aspects of a solution or business. Within the domain of solution evaluation, metrics furnish a framework to measure solution performance. A multitude of metrics can be employed to gauge tangible attributes of the solution, such as its throughput, productivity, or efficiency.</p><p>Typically, there are two prevalent categories of metrics delineated by the solution evaluation approach:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Acceptance Metrics:</strong> These metrics are employed to evaluate the solution or its individual components for acceptance during its developmental phase or shortly after. These metrics work within the confines of pre-defined acceptance criteria that establish permissible ranges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value Metrics:</strong> These metrics are typically deployed at a later stage to discern if the anticipated business value has been realized. Since the assessment of solution performance is delayed till post-release, there&#39;s a possibility that the selected metrics or their measurement methodology might evolve.</p></li></ol><p>For an effective solution evaluation approach, teams should deliberate on several key aspects regarding metrics:</p><ul><li><p>The specific performance data needed for the metrics, its collection frequency, and methodology.</p></li><li><p>The individuals or teams accountable for amassing and presenting this performance data.</p></li><li><p>Existing mechanisms for data collection and reporting for these metrics. If absent, identification of additional required capabilities and the associated financial implications.</p></li></ul><p>The foundational knowledge about the problem or opportunity the solution intends to address and the defined product scope can guide the selection of suitable metrics. Existing industry or organizational standards might offer benchmarks to juxtapose the solution against general expectations.</p><p>It&#39;s paramount to define the solution evaluation approach early in the product development life cycle. An early definition can preempt potential challenges, especially concerning metrics that might need additional data beyond the product&#39;s innate requirements. Delayed definitions could lead to escalated costs or the infeasibility of data acquisition. In cases where proposed metrics prove to be exorbitantly costly or time-intensive, more cost-effective alternatives might be explored.</p><h3 id="inputs-1" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="metrics-and-kpis" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Metrics and KPIs</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#metrics-and-kpis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Metrics and KPIs](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Metrics and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are quantifiable measures used to evaluate and track the success or performance of specific business processes or goals.

Through this, stakeholders can be confident that what they&#39;ve agreed upon during development is what will be delivered.</p><h3 id="stakeholder-engagement" tabindex="-1">Stakeholder Engagement <a class="header-anchor" href="#stakeholder-engagement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stakeholder Engagement&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This process provides a platform for stakeholders who hold responsibility for the product to make decisions. They can decide if the solution should be:</p><ul><li>Released entirely</li><li>Released in parts</li><li>Not released at all</li></ul><p>The term &quot;release&quot; in the context of solution acceptance can have dual meanings:</p><ol><li>Releasing a solution or part of it into a production environment while still under the purview of its development team.</li><li>Transferring the solution or part of it to an operational area which will then assume responsibility for it.</li></ol><h3 id="basis-for-release-decisions" tabindex="-1">Basis for Release Decisions <a class="header-anchor" href="#basis-for-release-decisions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Basis for Release Decisions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The decision to release a solution predominantly depends on the following factors:</p><ul><li>The solution&#39;s acceptability, as determined by the assessed acceptance results.</li><li>Assurance that the organization is equipped and ready for the release.</li><li>Verification that all the preparatory activities for the release have been adequately completed. This encompasses harmonizing this solution release with any other simultaneous releases.</li><li>Acceptance of any lingering product risks and the possible solutions or workarounds to address those risks.</li></ul><p>An additional consideration is the warranty period. This is a specified duration post-release during which the development team remains liable for rectifying any defects detected after the solution has been released into production.</p><h3 id="sign-off-in-release-decision" tabindex="-1">Sign-off in Release Decision <a class="header-anchor" href="#sign-off-in-release-decision" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sign-off in Release Decision&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The process of obtaining a release decision might require sign-off. The nature of this sign-off, whether formal or informal, is influenced by the organizational norms and the type of project life cycle:</p><ul><li><strong>Iterative or Adaptive Project Life Cycle</strong>: Typically, an informal sign-off happens at the close of each sprint or iteration. A formal sign-off, when mandated, is obtained before each solution release into the production setting.</li><li><strong>Predictive Project Life Cycle</strong>: Here, the sign-off usually takes place towards the end of the project life cycle. This can be either just before the release into production or after the release once the warranty period has concluded.</li></ul><p>The process of obtaining solution acceptance for release ensures that all stakeholders are in agreement, and the solution meets the organizational requirements before it&#39;s delivered into a production environment.</p><h3 id="inputs-3" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="product-scope-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Product Scope</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#product-scope-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Product Scope is a critical input in the process of establishing relationships and dependencies.
