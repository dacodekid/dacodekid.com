In this visual and interactive exercise, the &quot;speedboat&quot; represents a project, product, or process that stakeholders and team members wish to improve. The &quot;anchors&quot; represent the issues or problems that are holding it back from reaching its full potential.</p><h3 id="key-components" tabindex="-1">Key Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Components&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Visual Board</strong>: Typically a whiteboard or flipchart depicting a speedboat and multiple anchors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Facilitator</strong>: Someone to guide the session, clarify rules, and ensure objectives are met.</p></li><li><p><strong>Participants</strong>: Team members, stakeholders, and others who are interested or impacted by the area under discussion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Markers, Sticky Notes</strong>: Used by participants to write down and visually place their anchors on the board.</p></li><li><p><strong>Timebox</strong>: The session is usually time-constrained to ensure focus.</p></li></ul><h3 id="how-it-works" tabindex="-1">How It Works <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How It Works&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Introduction and Context</strong>: The facilitator sets the stage by explaining the metaphor of the speedboat and anchors.

Similar anchors can be grouped together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prioritize and Analyze</strong>: The team collaboratively prioritizes the anchors based on impact, urgency, or other relevant criteria.</p></li><li><p><strong>Action Planning</strong>: Based on the discussion and prioritization, action items or recommendations are formulated for removing or mitigating the anchors.</p></li></ol><h3 id="advantages" tabindex="-1">Advantages <a class="header-anchor" href="#advantages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Advantages&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Problem Identification</strong>: Provides a structured way to identify and articulate issues or challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>: Ensures active involvement of stakeholders by allowing them to physically place and discuss their anchors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collective Insight</strong>: Enables teams to benefit from diverse viewpoints and facilitates consensus-building.</p></li><li><p><strong>Focus on Improvement</strong>: Drives the team to think about solutions and action plans for the issues identified.</p></li></ul><p>The Speedboat technique is often used in Agile environments but is versatile enough to be useful in any framework or methodology.
