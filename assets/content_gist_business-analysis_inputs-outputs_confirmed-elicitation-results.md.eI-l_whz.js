This process is integral to ensuring that the requirements gathered are indeed reflective of the stakeholders&#39; needs and expectations. It serves as a quality check before the requirements are formally documented or used in subsequent activities such as analysis, documentation, and validation.</p><p>They represent a form of elicitation results that have undergone a process of validation and consensus-building among the product team and other stakeholders.</p><h2 id="common-understanding" tabindex="-1">Common Understanding <a class="header-anchor" href="#common-understanding" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Common Understanding&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One of the critical attributes of confirmed elicitation results is that they signify a &quot;common understanding&quot; among the project&#39;s product team. This means that all involved parties are in agreement about the accuracy of the elicited information.</p><h2 id="formation" tabindex="-1">Formation <a class="header-anchor" href="#formation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Formation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Confirmed elicitation results can be arrived at in two primary ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Post-Elicitation Review</strong>: After the elicitation activities are completed, a group of stakeholders reviews the materials. Their consensus on the accuracy of the information transitions the results from &quot;unconfirmed&quot; to &quot;confirmed.&quot;</li><li><strong>Concurrent Confirmation</strong>: Alternatively, confirmation can occur in real-time as elicitation activities are being carried out.</li></ul><h2 id="components" tabindex="-1">Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Components&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Confirmed elicitation results comprise various types of information, including notes, requirements, and other outputs from completed elicitation activities. These form the foundational data for creating first-draft models and for further analysis.</p><h2 id="utility-in-various-contexts" tabindex="-1">Utility in Various Contexts <a class="header-anchor" href="#utility-in-various-contexts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Utility in Various Contexts&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Model Creation</strong>: Confirmed elicitation results often serve as the base for creating first-draft models. As these models are further examined, additional questions about scope, processes, rules, data, or interfaces may arise that necessitate further elicitation activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Draft Requirements Identification</strong>: These confirmed results often serve as a starting point for identifying draft requirements. Typically, this information is collected from subject matter experts (SMEs) or identified in source materials during the elicitation activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gap Analysis</strong>: The confirmed elicitation results are crucial in identifying and filling gaps within the project. They are used in conjunction with analysis models to ensure that the entire solution is holistically examined, preventing missing, inconsistent, or conflicting requirements.</p></li></ul><h2 id="not-the-final-requirements" tabindex="-1">Not the Final Requirements <a class="header-anchor" href="#not-the-final-requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Not the Final Requirements&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It&#39;s essential to note that even though confirmed elicitation results have gained a level of validation and agreement, they are not considered &quot;final requirements&quot; until they have undergone further analysis. They are merely a more solidified form of the raw elicitation results that provide a reliable foundation for subsequent project phases.</p><p>In summary, confirmed elicitation results serve as an agreed-upon informational foundation for various business analysis processes, from creating initial models to identifying draft requirements and performing gap analysis. Their &quot;confirmed&quot; status indicates that they have reached a level of validation and consensus among stakeholders, making them more reliable for progressing through subsequent phases of the project.</p><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1">Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2>',16);function c(u,h,d,f,m,p){const e=i("QuizJS");return a(),n("div",null,[l,o(e,{quizData:[{question:'What is the primary purpose of the process "Confirm Elicitation Results" in business analysis?',choices:[{key:"A",text:"To allocate the project's budget based on elicited information"},{key:"B",text:"To verify the accuracy and completeness of the elicited information"},{key:"C",text:"To finalize the project's communication strategy"},{key:"D",text:"To establish the legal framework for the project"}],answer:"B",explanation:`The process of "Confirm Elicitation Results" is integral for verifying the accuracy and completeness of the information gathered through elicitation techniques, ensuring that it reflects the stakeholders' needs and expectations.`},{question:'How is a "common understanding" relevant in the context of confirmed elicitation results?',choices:[{key:"A",text:"It signifies agreement among the product team about the accuracy of elicited information"},{key:"B",text:"It refers to a standardized method for budget allocation"},{key:"C",text:"It indicates a universal approach to legal compliance in projects"},{key:"D",text:"It is a term used for general stakeholder communication"}],answer:"A",explanation:`A critical attribute of confirmed elicitation results is that they signify a "common understanding" among the project's product team, indicating consensus on the accuracy of the elicited information.`},{question:"What is a key utility of confirmed elicitation results in the creation of models during the business analysis process?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"They serve as a base for creating first-draft models"},{key:"B",text:"They are used to finalize the project's technical architecture"},{key:"C",text:"They primarily focus on the aesthetic aspects of models"},{key:"D",text:"They dictate the project's marketing strategy"}],answer:"A",explanation:"Confirmed elicitation results often serve as the foundational data for creating first-draft models, providing a reliable starting point for further examination and analysis."},{question:'Why are confirmed elicitation results not considered "final requirements"?',choices:[{key:"A",text:"Because they focus solely on the financial aspects of the project"},{key:"B",text:"They require further analysis before being classified as final"},{key:"C",text:"They are typically disregarded in favor of stakeholder opinions"},{key:"D",text:"They are only used for establishing the project's communication plan"}],answer:"B",explanation:'Even though confirmed elicitation results have undergone a level of validation, they are not considered "final requirements" until they have been further analyzed and refined.'},{question:"In what way do confirmed elicitation results contribute to gap analysis in a project?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"By determining the project's final budget"},{key:"B",text:"They help identify and fill gaps within the project"},{key:"C",text:"They are used to finalize the legal documents for the project"},{key:"D",text:"They establish the final technical specifications of the product"}],answer:"B",explanation:"Confirmed elicitation results are crucial for gap analysis, as they are used in conjunction with analysis models to ensure that the entire solution is thoroughly examined, preventing missing, inconsistent, or conflicting requirements."}]},null,8,["quizData"])])}const q=t(r,[["render",c]]);export{g as __pageData,q as default};
