This hands-on approach provides a valuable means to validate whether the conceptual solution aligns well with the existing set of requirements and helps to identify any potential gaps.</p><p>Prototyping embraces the idea of progressive elaboration, involving iterative cycles of creating mockups, allowing user interaction, gathering feedback, and then refining the prototype. The prototype can be anything from a simple architectural model to an early version of the product itself. Through this iterative process, requirements can be refined and more closely aligned with stakeholder expectations and needs.</p><h2 id="evolutionary-prototyping" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/evolutionary-prototyping.html">Evolutionary Prototyping</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#evolutionary-prototyping" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Evolutionary Prototyping](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/evolutionary-prototyping.md)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Evolutionary Prototyping is a technique where a model of the system is built and refined iteratively based on stakeholder feedback, until it evolves into the final product.</p><h2 id="storyboarding" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/storyboarding.html">Storyboarding</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#storyboarding" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Storyboarding](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/storyboarding.md)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Storyboarding involves creating a series of illustrations or images displayed in sequence to pre-visualize a solution or to illustrate a process flow.
