They are often used in the context of website or software development as a part of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design. Wireframes serve to establish the architecture and layout of the page or system, providing a clear and simplified visual guide that shows how elements are arranged and interact.</p><h3 id="objectives-and-usage" tabindex="-1">Objectives and Usage <a class="header-anchor" href="#objectives-and-usage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objectives and Usage&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Layout Design</strong>: Wireframes primarily focus on the placement of elements and layout design, giving stakeholders an idea of where each element will appear on a page.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functional Specifications</strong>: Wireframes may include functional aspects like clickable buttons, links, and other interactive elements, indicating how the user will interact with them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Content Structuring</strong>: Wireframes help in placing text areas, images, and other media, showing how content will be arranged.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Alignment</strong>: They serve as a point of discussion among designers, developers, and other stakeholders to agree on the system&#39;s layout and functionalities before development starts.</p></li></ul><h3 id="characteristics" tabindex="-1">Characteristics <a class="header-anchor" href="#characteristics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Characteristics&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Low to High Fidelity</strong>: Wireframes can range from low-fidelity, hand-drawn sketches to high-fidelity, digital mock-ups that are interactive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Annotations</strong>: Similar to storyboards, wireframes can include annotations to describe functionality, behavior, or any data flow behind the scenes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Agility</strong>: They can be easily modified, making them an agile tool suitable for iterative development processes.</p></li></ul><h3 id="applications" tabindex="-1">Applications <a class="header-anchor" href="#applications" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Applications&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Prototyping</strong>: Wireframes often act as the first step in the prototyping process, laying the groundwork for more detailed prototypes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Requirements Validation</strong>: They can be used to validate functional and UI requirements by providing stakeholders with a tangible or visible representation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Development Guidance</strong>: They can guide front-end developers in the layout and functional aspects of the system.</p></li></ul><h3 id="relationship-to-requirements" tabindex="-1">Relationship to Requirements <a class="header-anchor" href="#relationship-to-requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relationship to Requirements&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Detailing Requirements</strong>: Wireframes make abstract requirements concrete by visualizing them, which can lead to more detailed or refined requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>User Flow</strong>: They can be used in conjunction with use cases and user stories to visualize how the user will navigate through different features, helping to identify any gaps in requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functional Mapping</strong>: Wireframes allow for the visual mapping of functional specifications, aiding in both requirements elicitation and communication among stakeholders.</p></li></ul><h3 id="limitations-and-risks" tabindex="-1">Limitations and Risks <a class="header-anchor" href="#limitations-and-risks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Limitations and Risks&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Design Limitations</strong>: Wireframes are generally not concerned with design aesthetics like color, font, or actual images, focusing more on functionality and layout.</p></li><li><p><strong>Potential Misinterpretation</strong>: Stakeholders might mistake wireframes for the final design and may not understand that they are a preliminary step.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scope Creep</strong>: Because wireframes make it easier to add features, there&#39;s a risk of scope creep if not managed properly.</p></li></ul><p>Wireframes are a critical tool in the business analysis and system development lifecycle. They offer a tangible, visual representation of abstract requirements and assumptions, facilitating better understanding, elicitation, and validation of requirements. Effective wireframing can bridge the gap between business requirements and the solutions designed to meet those requirements.</p>',13),r=[n];function o(l,c,d,h,p,u){return t(),i("div",null,r)}const f=e(s,[["render",o]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
