This helps in ensuring that each element is aligned with and supports the business objectives of the project.<br><br>"},{id:7104,question:"How does a Traceability Matrix aid in the validation of requirements?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"By focusing on the aesthetic aspects of the project."},{key:"B",text:"It maps requirements to business objectives to ensure each requirement contributes value and prevents scope creep."},{key:"C",text:"The Traceability Matrix is not used for validating requirements."},{key:"D",text:"It validates requirements by extending the project deadline."}],answer:"B",explanation:"During the validation phase, a Traceability Matrix is used to map requirements to business objectives. This ensures that each requirement contributes value to the project and supports the achievement of business objectives.

Unlike the comprehensive Traceability Matrix, the Interaction Matrix is temporary and captures a specific point in time. This allows for quick assessments of the sufficiency and completeness of requirements at that moment, aligning with the flexible and dynamic nature of adaptive methodologies.<br>"}]},null,8,["quizData"])])}const x=t(o,[["render",c]]);export{f as __pageData,x as default};
