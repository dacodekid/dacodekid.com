It is especially beneficial in understanding detailed processes that stakeholders might find challenging to articulate. The technique can be particularly revealing for capturing actions or behaviors that stakeholders may not be consciously aware of, hence may overlook in discussions or interviews.</p><h2 id="objectives-and-usage" tabindex="-1">Objectives and Usage <a class="header-anchor" href="#objectives-and-usage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objectives and Usage&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Uncovering Hidden Information</strong>: The primary objective of observation is to unearth details and nuances that stakeholders might not be able or willing to provide explicitly. This could be because they are unaware of these details or because they find them difficult to articulate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Formulating Product Requirements</strong>: Observations can yield valuable insights that contribute to the formulation of specific product requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cross-Verification</strong>: The technique serves as a means to cross-check information obtained through other elicitation methods against the actual scenario. It validates or refines the elicitation outcomes.</p></li></ul><h2 id="characteristics" tabindex="-1">Characteristics <a class="header-anchor" href="#characteristics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Characteristics&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Observer Role</strong>: The observer can either view the process or task as an outsider or engage in the process firsthand to gain an experiential understanding.</p></li><li><p><strong>Environmental Context</strong>: Observation occurs within the natural setting of the stakeholder, enhancing the credibility and applicability of the information collected.</p></li><li><p><strong>Behavioral Alterations</strong>: A notable limitation is the &quot;observer effect,&quot; where stakeholders may alter their behavior because they know they are being observed, which may skew the data.</p></li></ul><h2 id="applications" tabindex="-1">Applications <a class="header-anchor" href="#applications" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Applications&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Process Analysis</strong>: Useful in capturing detailed steps involved in complex processes, often revealing bottlenecks or inefficiencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>User Experience</strong>: Effective for understanding how end-users interact with a product, thereby informing design improvements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Validation</strong>: When used in conjunction with other techniques like interviews or surveys, observations can serve to validate or challenge the information obtained through those channels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Collection</strong>: In some cases, observations may be recorded for further analysis, either through note-taking or electronic recording methods.</p></li></ul><p>Observation offers a real-world view of processes and behaviors, providing a rich context for the identification and formulation of requirements.
