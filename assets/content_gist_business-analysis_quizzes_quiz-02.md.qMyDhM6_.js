This approach aligns with the progressive elaboration of requirements, facilitating incremental requirement development. Initiating traceability after all requirements are detailed would be too delayed, contradicting the concept of rolling wave planning in requirement development. While establishing a formal traceability matrix, it's unnecessary to wait until a requirement is fully detailed from start to end, as traceability matrices are typically built in a hierarchical manner, starting with high-level requirements and adding details progressively.

As requirements are approved, corresponding work products across various phases are created, ensuring that no gaps exist between what is approved and what is built or tested. The Requirement Traceability Matrix assists in monitoring these relationships and is thus pivotal in understanding the breadth of a business analyst's involvement in tracking approved requirements and their associated work products.<br><br>"},{id:1936,question:"In a situation where David, a business analyst, notices that certain design documents are missing in relation to approved requirements, and the business value of these requirements has diminished during development, what should his next step be?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"Dismiss the approved requirements due to their low current business value"},{key:"B",text:"Instruct the team to immediately create the missing work products"},{key:"C",text:"Decide whether to cancel the approved requirements or create the missing work products later, based on current business value"},{key:"D",text:"Escalate the issue to the project sponsor"}],answer:"C",explanation:"When discrepancies between approved requirements and the developed work products are discovered, a business analyst should evaluate whether to cancel or defer the requirements, or create the missing work products.

This linkage ensures that all work aligns with the defined scope. Including every work product as a requirement attribute in the requirement traceability matrix can lead to excessive tracking and isn't a practical approach.
