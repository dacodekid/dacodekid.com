This process is essential because it pinpoints whose concerns and inputs must be considered throughout all business analysis activities.</p><h2 id="definition" tabindex="-1">Definition <a class="header-anchor" href="#definition" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Definition&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>PMBOK® Guide Definition</strong>: The PMBOK® Guide describes a stakeholder as any individual, group, or organization that could influence, be influenced by, or think they might be influenced by a decision, activity, or result of a portfolio, program, or project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business Analysis Definition</strong>: When it comes to business analysis, a stakeholder is defined slightly differently. Here, a stakeholder is any individual, group, or organization that might influence, be influenced by, or perceive themselves as being influenced by the solution. In this context, such stakeholders can be described as &quot;product stakeholders&quot;.</p></li></ul><p>Product stakeholders are actively involved in identifying requirements. They provide crucial inputs during requirements elicitation by delivering business analysis data. This data then forms the foundation for shaping product requirements. It&#39;s important to note that stakeholder identification is fluid. An individual or group that identifies or perceives themselves as a product stakeholder at the beginning might see their role or perception change as more details about the situation and product requirements unfold. As the solution progresses, product teams utilize the defined product scope and results from analysis to make necessary modifications to the list of stakeholders. In the context of this standard and guide, whenever the term &quot;stakeholder&quot; is used, it&#39;s referring to those influenced by the solution, implying the term &quot;product stakeholder&quot;.</p><h2 id="collaboration-is-key" tabindex="-1">Collaboration is Key <a class="header-anchor" href="#collaboration-is-key" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Collaboration is Key&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The act of identifying stakeholders isn&#39;t exclusive to business analysis.
