These review processes serve to validate the deliverables for compliance with organizational standards and universally accepted principles of writing requirements.</p><h2 id="peer-desk-check-1" tabindex="-1">Peer Desk Check <a class="header-anchor" href="#peer-desk-check-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Peer Desk Check&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Peer Desk Check is an informal review approach where one or more peers review the materials simultaneously. This approach is particularly useful for validating any logic inherent in the requirements or analysis models. During a desk check, a peer reviewer systematically walks through an analysis model or set of requirements to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or logical flaws. They may work through examples to check the logic within the deliverables. This is akin to a developer debugging code and is valuable for scrutinizing the logic encapsulated in a set of business rules.</p><h2 id="peer-review" tabindex="-1">Peer Review <a class="header-anchor" href="#peer-review" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Peer Review&quot;">​</a></h2><p>On the other hand, Peer Reviews can be either formal or informal and are conducted at various stages during the requirements process. Participants in the review often include other business analysts, managers, or members from the Business Analysis Center of Excellence. Quality assurance and testing resources also often participate as they provide a valuable perspective on testability, completeness, and consistency of the requirements.</p><p>Informal peer reviews may occur prior to a more formal requirements review meeting with business stakeholders. This ensures that any glaring errors that could disrupt the formal review are addressed beforehand. Post-stakeholder review sessions may also be conducted to ensure that the final set of requirements is universally understood and accepted by the solution and development teams.</p><p>The execution of a peer review is straightforward. All reviewers are provided with a copy of the document for pre-review. During the review session, issues or problems are collaboratively discussed and addressed. Screen-sharing technology can be leveraged to make real-time changes to the document, ensuring a more efficient resolution of identified issues. In instances where a formal session isn&#39;t conducted, the document can be distributed electronically with reviewers asked to track their changes. Various features in requirements management tools can also be used to log comments and suggestions.</p><h2 id="collaboration-point" tabindex="-1">Collaboration Point <a class="header-anchor" href="#collaboration-point" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Collaboration Point&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Inviting testers and those responsible for developing training manuals to the verification review can be beneficial. Their early involvement provides them with the necessary project background and context. This ensures a more detailed and focused review, particularly in terms of the consistency, completeness, and testability of the requirements, thereby adding value to the verification process.</p><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1">Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2>',11);function l(h,d,u,p,m,f){const e=t("QuizJS");return i(),a("div",null,[c,r(e,{quizData:[{question:"What is the main purpose of conducting a Peer Desk Check in business analysis?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"To formally approve the budget for the project."},{key:"B",text:"To informally review materials for logical consistency and identify any errors or inconsistencies in the analysis models or requirements."},{key:"C",text:"It is used to delegate tasks among team members."},{key:"D",text:"Peer Desk Check is specifically for technical coding reviews, not business analysis."}],answer:"B",explanation:"The main purpose of a Peer Desk Check is to conduct an informal review where peers assess materials such as analysis models or requirements, aiming to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or logical flaws."},{question:"How does a Peer Review differ from a Peer Desk Check in its approach?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"Peer Reviews are less detailed and only conducted at the end of a project."},{key:"B",text:"Peer Review, which can be formal or informal, involves a broader group of participants and is conducted at various stages of the requirements process."},{key:"C",text:"Peer Reviews are only for reviewing financial aspects of a project."},{key:"D",text:"There is no difference; both are the same process."}],answer:"B",explanation:"Peer Review differs from Peer Desk Check in that it can be either formal or informal, involves a wider range of participants, and is conducted at various stages of the requirements process for a more comprehensive review."},{question:"What role do quality assurance and testing resources play in Peer Reviews?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"They primarily focus on the technical development aspects of the project."},{key:"B",text:"Quality assurance and testing resources provide valuable perspectives on testability, completeness, and consistency of the requirements."},{key:"C",text:"Their role is limited to post-deployment testing."},{key:"D",text:"They are involved only for budgeting purposes."}],answer:"B",explanation:"Quality assurance and testing resources play a crucial role in Peer Reviews by providing insights on the testability, completeness, and consistency of the requirements, enhancing the quality of the review process."},{question:"Why is it beneficial to involve testers and those developing training manuals in the verification review process?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"They provide insights primarily on the financial feasibility of the project."},{key:"B",text:"Their involvement ensures a more detailed and focused review, particularly in terms of consistency, completeness, and testability of the requirements."},{key:"C",text:"Their involvement is only necessary for marketing purposes."},{key:"D",text:"They are involved solely to manage the project timeline."}],answer:"B",explanation:"Involving testers and those responsible for developing training manuals in the verification review process is beneficial as it ensures a more detailed and focused review, especially regarding the requirements' consistency, completeness, and testability."},{question:"What is a key advantage of using screen-sharing technology during a Peer Review session?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"It allows for the review to be postponed and rescheduled easily."},{key:"B",text:"Screen-sharing technology enables real-time changes to documents, facilitating efficient resolution of identified issues."},{key:"C",text:"The technology is used exclusively for remote project presentations, not for reviews."},{key:"D",text:"It allows participants to avoid active involvement in the review process."}],answer:"B",explanation:"The use of screen-sharing technology during a Peer Review session is advantageous as it enables participants to make real-time changes to the document under review, leading to a more efficient and collaborative resolution of issues."}]},null,8,["quizData"])])}const g=s(o,[["render",l]]);export{y as __pageData,g as default};
