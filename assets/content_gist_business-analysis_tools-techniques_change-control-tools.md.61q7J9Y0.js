These tools, which can be manual or automated, play a crucial role in handling change requests and the decisions that follow. They are often pre-existing within organizations but may also be introduced specifically for a project. It is vital to consider the needs of all stakeholders involved in the change control process when implementing these tools.</p><h2 id="configuration-management-system-cms" tabindex="-1">Configuration Management System (CMS) <a class="header-anchor" href="#configuration-management-system-cms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Configuration Management System (CMS)&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The CMS is designed to ensure that the solution being developed adheres to its approved product information.</li><li><strong>Process</strong>: It provides a systematic process for verifying solution conformance, documenting changes, and reporting the status of each change throughout the project lifecycle.</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: Key components of CMS include comprehensive documentation, a tracking process, and defined approval levels for authorizing changes.</li><li><strong>Management Capability</strong>: It enables the management of changes not only in the context of the specific product but also considering other interdependent products.</li></ul><h2 id="version-control-system-vcs" tabindex="-1">Version Control System (VCS) <a class="header-anchor" href="#version-control-system-vcs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Version Control System (VCS)&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Functionality</strong>: A VCS is responsible for tracking the revision history of any type of work product.</li><li><strong>Comparison with Baseline</strong>: It acts similarly to a baseline by establishing an original work product and tracking subsequent modifications.</li><li><strong>Relation to CMS</strong>: VCS is a part of CMS, representing one of the many functions encompassed by configuration management.</li></ul><h2 id="further-exploration" tabindex="-1">Further Exploration <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-exploration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further Exploration&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For a more detailed discussion on change control tools and their applications in business analysis, refer to Section 5.8.2 of &quot;Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide.&quot; This section provides deeper insights into the practical usage and benefits of these tools in managing project changes effectively.</p><p>In conclusion, the effective use of change control tools like CMS and VCS in predictive project lifecycles is vital for maintaining the integrity and consistency of project outcomes.
