This game serves as an elicitation technique that engages stakeholders and team members in a creative process to envision and describe key attributes, features, and benefits of a product. The exercise allows participants to create a physical &quot;box&quot; using markers, paper, or other materials to represent what they consider to be the most important aspects of the product.</p><h2 id="key-components" tabindex="-1">Key Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Components&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Box Materials</strong>: Items such as cardstock, markers, stickers, and other craft supplies are typically provided to participants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Facilitator</strong>: The individual who sets the context, explains the rules, and ensures that the game&#39;s objectives are met.</p></li><li><p><strong>Participants</strong>: Team members, stakeholders, and/or subject matter experts who actively contribute to the game by designing their own product boxes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Timebox</strong>: The game is usually time-limited to maintain focus and energy levels.</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-it-works" tabindex="-1">How It Works <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How It Works&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Context Setting</strong>: The Facilitator sets the stage by explaining the goal of the exercise and provides the materials needed to create the product box.</p></li><li><p><strong>Box Creation</strong>: Participants use the materials to create a box that represents their vision of the product.
