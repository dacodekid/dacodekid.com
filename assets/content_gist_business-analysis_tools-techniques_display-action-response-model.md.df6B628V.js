While the DAR model is not explicitly outlined in PMI&#39;s Guide to Business Analysis, it can serve as a useful framework for business analysts to understand and document the system&#39;s behavior from the user&#39;s perspective.</p><h2 id="components-of-the-display-action-response-model" tabindex="-1">Components of the Display-Action-Response Model <a class="header-anchor" href="#components-of-the-display-action-response-model" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Components of the Display-Action-Response Model&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Display</strong>: This refers to what the user sees on the screen. It includes everything from text and graphics to buttons and other interactive elements. The display provides the user with the context and options for what can be done within a specific interface or part of the system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Action</strong>: This component focuses on what the user does in response to the display. Actions could be as simple as clicking a button or as complex as entering data into multiple fields. The action is essentially the user&#39;s interaction with the system based on what is displayed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Response</strong>: This is how the system reacts to the user&#39;s action. Responses can be immediate or delayed and may involve changes to the display, performing computations, or triggering other actions. The response provides the user with feedback about the action they have taken.</p></li></ul><h2 id="when-to-use-dar" tabindex="-1">When to Use DAR <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-to-use-dar" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When to Use DAR&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>System Design &amp; Prototyping</strong>: DAR is commonly used during the design and prototyping stages to plan out the flow of interactions within the system.</li><li><strong>User Experience Testing</strong>: Business analysts can employ the DAR model to create test scenarios to evaluate how intuitive and responsive a system is from the user&#39;s perspective.</li><li><strong>Documentation</strong>: The DAR model can be used to create comprehensive documentation that captures the flow of user interactions, helping stakeholders understand the system&#39;s behavior.</li></ul><h2 id="relationship-to-business-analysis" tabindex="-1">Relationship to Business Analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#relationship-to-business-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relationship to Business Analysis&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Requirements Elicitation and Analysis</strong>: Understanding the user-system interactions can help in eliciting more precise functional and non-functional requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traceability</strong>: The DAR model helps trace user interactions back to specific requirements, providing a clear path from needs to features.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>: By framing the system&#39;s behavior in terms of display, action, and response, it&#39;s easier for stakeholders to understand the system&#39;s functionalities, thereby facilitating clearer communication.</p></li></ul><p>In summary, the DAR model offers a structured approach to understand and document the interactions between a user and a system, thereby aiding in better design, testing, and implementation.
