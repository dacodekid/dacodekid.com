They focus on ensuring that requirements and other product information are managed correctly throughout the product&#39;s lifecycle.</p><h2 id="key-concepts" tabindex="-1">Key Concepts <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Concepts&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Traceability</strong>: It&#39;s the ability to link and track information throughout the product lifecycle. The connections made are known as relationships or dependencies. The term &#39;bidirectional&#39; is used because requirements can be traced both backward (from requirement to its origin) and forward (from requirement to its final implementation). Backward traceability links requirements to the original business goals or objectives that necessitated them, while forward traceability connects requirements to the design, test components, and the final product. There&#39;s also lateral tracing, which involves linking textual data with models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Once product information gets the nod, it&#39;s vital to ensure it remains accurate throughout its lifecycle. Monitoring encompasses the management of changes to this product information and offers insights into the necessary actions to maintain the product&#39;s quality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traceability Across Projects</strong>: The principles and thinking rooted in Traceability and Monitoring are universal. They apply across all projects and their life cycles. Understanding the interrelations between requirements and other project aspects, like tests or releases, is paramount for ensuring consistency and completion of the project. Traceability supports change impact analysis, confirming objectives fulfillment, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage. Moreover, it aids in identifying missing or superfluous requirements. Regardless of the project&#39;s life cycle type or how requirements are documented, tracking and monitoring completed requirements is indispensable.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id="determine-traceability-and-monitoring-approach" tabindex="-1">Determine Traceability and Monitoring Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#determine-traceability-and-monitoring-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Determine Traceability and Monitoring Approach&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The process of &quot;Determine Traceability and Monitoring Approach&quot; revolves around how traceability is executed on varying scopes, from portfolios to individual products. This process defines how any alterations in requirements are overseen. The main advantage here is the tailoring of the traceability level and the structure of the requirements change management procedure according to the situation at hand.</p><p>Key components of this process are illustrated in Figures 8-2 and 8-3, presenting the inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs, as well as the data flow diagram respectively.</p><h3 id="core-aspects-of-the-approach" tabindex="-1">Core Aspects of the Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#core-aspects-of-the-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Core Aspects of the Approach&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The traceability and monitoring approach focuses on outlining traceability and change management methodologies for portfolios, programs, projects, or products.

It ensures that any modifications or defects arising during a project are scrutinized for their value and potential impact. This process ensures that only valuable changes, which support prioritization and subsequent product development, are integrated. This facilitates the addition of vital solution modifications while also curbing unnecessary alterations. By doing so, the stakeholders gain a clearer understanding of the effects of the changes on the final product.</p><p>When managing changes, the primary aim is to preserve the integrity of the requirements, associated deliverables, and work products. Moreover, it is crucial that any new requirements correspond with the initial business objectives and needs. By having a systematic process for requirements change, we can effectively manage changes to previously approved requirements. This minimizes the risks associated with unchecked or unauthorized alterations. A common pitfall in projects is making changes without assessing their repercussions, particularly in terms of dependencies. Such oversights can negatively affect the overall project and anticipated business value.</p><p>The nature of the project, be it adaptive or predictive, can influence the change management process:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Adaptive Projects</strong>: In these projects, changes are continuous. Here, stakeholders refine their requirements as different parts of the solution are presented sequentially. Since adaptive methodologies anticipate changes in requirements based on stakeholder feedback, a ranking system is utilized to decide the importance and timing of a proposed change.</p></li><li><p><strong>Predictive Projects</strong>: For these projects, a change refers to any alteration proposed post the finalization (or baselining) of requirements. Even though changes can be proposed at any stage, they are generally more challenging and costlier to implement in a predictive framework. A governing body usually evaluates these changes for their impact on ongoing tasks and previously approved requirements. A change is more probable to get the green light if its value outweighs the associated costs and resource implications.</p></li></ul><p>Once a proposed change is assessed, there are four potential outcomes:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Change Approved</strong>: Necessary revisions are made to the affected business analysis documents. Any ongoing or planned business analysis tasks are recalibrated to accommodate this change. In adaptive projects, the concept of &#39;approval&#39; is replaced by simply adding the proposed change to the product backlog.</p></li><li><p><strong>Change Deferred</strong>: The choice to postpone a change is recorded with an accompanying explanation. If a tentative date for considering the change in a future product release is given, it&#39;s marked in the relevant plans. In adaptive methodologies, this equates to assigning a lower priority to the proposed change in the product backlog.</p></li><li><p><strong>Change Rejected</strong>: The decision to dismiss a change is recorded with its respective rationale. No reminders for future consideration are set, indicating that the proposed work won&#39;t be pursued. For adaptive projects, this translates to either not adding or removing an item from the product backlog.</p></li><li><p><strong>More Information Required</strong>: Sometimes, the impact assessment might not be exhaustive, prompting the Change Control Board (CCB) or the approving team to seek additional details. This necessitates another round of data gathering and analysis, followed by an updated impact assessment and another review by the decision-making entity. In adaptive projects, items in the backlog are detailed sufficiently for prioritization, and if chosen, they are further expanded upon to gather details essential for development. The need for more details for a change is expected as this elaboration is integral to the methodology.</p></li></ol><p>Finally, the intensity of change management implemented hinges on various factors like the domain of application, organizational culture, available organizational process assets, project complexity, contractual stipulations, the project lifecycle, and the environment in which the project operates. The level of formality and the extent of documentation needed for managing changes are determined by organizational protocols, processes, or external mandates.</p><hr><h3 id="inputs-3" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="approved-requirements-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Approved Requirements</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#approved-requirements-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Approved Requirements](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Approved Requirements are a set of documented needs and expectations that have been formally agreed upon by stakeholders.
