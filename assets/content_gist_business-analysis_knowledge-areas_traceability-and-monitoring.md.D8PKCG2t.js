The connections made are known as relationships or dependencies. The term &#39;bidirectional&#39; is used because requirements can be traced both backward (from requirement to its origin) and forward (from requirement to its final implementation). Backward traceability links requirements to the original business goals or objectives that necessitated them, while forward traceability connects requirements to the design, test components, and the final product. There&#39;s also lateral tracing, which involves linking textual data with models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Once product information gets the nod, it&#39;s vital to ensure it remains accurate throughout its lifecycle. Monitoring encompasses the management of changes to this product information and offers insights into the necessary actions to maintain the product&#39;s quality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traceability Across Projects</strong>: The principles and thinking rooted in Traceability and Monitoring are universal. They apply across all projects and their life cycles. Understanding the interrelations between requirements and other project aspects, like tests or releases, is paramount for ensuring consistency and completion of the project. Traceability supports change impact analysis, confirming objectives fulfillment, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage. Moreover, it aids in identifying missing or superfluous requirements. Regardless of the project&#39;s life cycle type or how requirements are documented, tracking and monitoring completed requirements is indispensable.</p></li></ul><h2 id="processes" tabindex="-1">Processes <a class="header-anchor" href="#processes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Processes&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="determine-traceability-and-monitoring-approach" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/determine-traceability-and-monitoring-approach.html">Determine Traceability and Monitoring Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#determine-traceability-and-monitoring-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Determine Traceability and Monitoring Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/determine-traceability-and-monitoring-approach.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><h3 id="establish-relationships-and-dependencies" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/establish-relationships-and-dependencies.html">Establish Relationships and Dependencies</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#establish-relationships-and-dependencies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Establish Relationships and Dependencies](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/establish-relationships-and-dependencies.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><h3 id="select-and-approve-requirements" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/select-and-approve-requirements.html">Select and Approve Requirements</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#select-and-approve-requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Select and Approve Requirements](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/select-and-approve-requirements.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><h3 id="manage-changes-to-requirements-and-other-product-information" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/manage-changes-to-requirements-and-other-product-information.html">Manage Changes to Requirements and Other Product Information</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#manage-changes-to-requirements-and-other-product-information" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Manage Changes to Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/manage-changes-to-requirements-and-other-product-information.md)&quot;">​</a></h3>',9),r=[s];function o(c,l,d,h,p,m){return t(),n("div",null,r)}const b=e(i,[["render",o]]);export{g as __pageData,b as default};
