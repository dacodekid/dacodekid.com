This criterion provides dual advantages:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Refinement of Requirements:</strong> The criteria give further insights that aid in honing the requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Basis for Shared Understanding:</strong> It sets the stage for mutual understanding between stakeholders regarding the deliverables.</p></li></ol><h3 id="acceptance-criteria-in-different-contexts" tabindex="-1">Acceptance Criteria in Different Contexts <a class="header-anchor" href="#acceptance-criteria-in-different-contexts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Acceptance Criteria in Different Contexts&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In the context of portfolios or programs, the acceptance criteria usually remain at a more generalized level, focusing primarily on the broad objectives. The acceptance criteria here derive from several sources:</p><ul><li>Goals and Objectives: What the project or program aims to achieve.</li><li>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Metrics that evaluate the performance of an activity.</li><li>Project Metrics: Measures associated with the project&#39;s performance.</li><li>Customer Metrics: Indicators related to customer satisfaction and feedback.</li><li>Sales and Marketing Metrics: Measures related to sales performance and marketing effectiveness.</li><li>Operational Metrics: Metrics that gauge the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.</li></ul><p>These sources are elaborated upon in Section 6.5.3 of the Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide.</p><h3 id="formats-and-approaches" tabindex="-1">Formats and Approaches <a class="header-anchor" href="#formats-and-approaches" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Formats and Approaches&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In adaptive methodologies, acceptance criteria commonly adopt a behavior-driven development format. However, the format is not set in stone and can vary based on consensus between stakeholders and developers.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="analysis-approach" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Analysis Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#analysis-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Analysis Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Analysis Approach is a method or structured way to analyze the gathered data and information. This input provides guidance on how the requirements and other relevant product information should be analyzed, helping to ensure that the acceptance criteria are derived from valid and verifiable data sources.</p><h4 id="analysis-models" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.html">Analysis Models</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#analysis-models" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Analysis Models](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Analysis Models are representations of requirements or product information. These models could include flow diagrams, data models, or other types of diagrams that provide a visual representation. They serve as references for understanding requirements in a structured manner and help in deriving acceptance criteria that align with the requirements.</p><h4 id="requirements-and-other-product-information" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Requirements and Other Product Information</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#requirements-and-other-product-information" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Requirements and other product information refer to the detailed descriptions of what the product should do and how it should perform. This input is crucial as the acceptance criteria are directly derived from these requirements ensuring that the end product meets the intended specifications.</p><h4 id="solution-evaluation-approach" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.html">Solution Evaluation Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#solution-evaluation-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Solution Evaluation Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Solution Evaluation Approach is a structured method to assess the solution against the set requirements and acceptance criteria. By having this approach in place, one can ensure that the acceptance criteria set is both measurable and achievable within the solution&#39;s constraints.</p><h3 id="tools-and-techniques" tabindex="-1">Tools and Techniques <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools-and-techniques" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools and Techniques&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="behavior-driven-development" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.html">Behavior-Driven Development</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#behavior-driven-development" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Behavior-Driven Development](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that promotes collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical participants in a software project. BDD focuses on defining behaviors or actions of a system and then developing the software to meet those behaviors. This technique helps in defining clear acceptance criteria based on expected behaviors.</p><h4 id="definition-of-done" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.html">Definition of Done</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#definition-of-done" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Definition of Done](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Definition of Done provides clear criteria for when a task or requirement is considered complete. It ensures consistency in understanding the completion state across stakeholders. When defining acceptance criteria, the Definition of Done helps in ensuring clarity and precision.</p><h4 id="story-elaboration" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.html">Story Elaboration</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#story-elaboration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Story Elaboration](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Story Elaboration is the process of breaking down user stories or requirements into detailed tasks or sub-tasks. This tool helps in understanding the depth of a requirement and ensures that all aspects are covered when setting acceptance criteria.</p><h3 id="outputs" tabindex="-1">Outputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#outputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Outputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="acceptance-criteria" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Acceptance Criteria</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#acceptance-criteria" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Acceptance Criteria](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Acceptance Criteria are the specific conditions that a product or feature must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders.
