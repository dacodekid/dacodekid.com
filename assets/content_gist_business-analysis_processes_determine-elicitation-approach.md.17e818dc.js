Elicitation in the context of the PMI Guide to Business Analysis refers to the act of drawing out or extracting information, often in the form of requirements, from stakeholders or other sources. It is a planned process that involves selecting and applying techniques to capture pertinent data.</p><h3 id="purpose-and-key-benefits" tabindex="-1">Purpose and Key Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#purpose-and-key-benefits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Purpose and Key Benefits&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The primary purpose of determining the elicitation approach is to streamline and enhance the process of collecting requirements. This is achieved by considering various factors such as the stakeholders involved, the elicitation techniques to be used, and the sequence of activities.</p><p>Benefits include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Efficient Use of Stakeholder Time</strong>: By having a structured approach, the time of the stakeholders is utilized effectively.
