This approach aligns with the progressive elaboration of requirements, facilitating incremental requirement development. Initiating traceability after all requirements are detailed would be too delayed, contradicting the concept of rolling wave planning in requirement development. While establishing a formal traceability matrix, it's unnecessary to wait until a requirement is fully detailed from start to end, as traceability matrices are typically built in a hierarchical manner, starting with high-level requirements and adding details progressively. As lower-level requirements emerge, they should be assessed for alignment with higher-level ones. Although defining the traceability format is crucial, traceability can commence with the detailing of the first requirement."},{question:"When is business analysis traceability considered complete?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Upon mutual agreement with business stakeholders, usually during planning"},{key:"B",text:"When every requirement is fully articulated and detailed"},{key:"C",text:"As soon as all requirements are included in the requirement traceability matrix"},{key:"D",text:"After at least one requirement is articulated and detailed in the traceability matrix"}],answer:{key:"A",text:"Upon mutual agreement with business stakeholders, usually during planning"},explanation:"Business analysis traceability completion varies across organizations and is typically decided during planning in collaboration with business stakeholders.

Some require formal sign-off on documents like business requirement documents, while others may accept informal, verbal approval. The approval process is typically established and documented during business analysis planning. This early determination helps prevent conflicts later during the approval phase. The business analyst, along with the project manager and sponsor, decides the levels of requirement approval during the planning phase, using tools like RACI for facilitating these decisions."},{question:"What is the Work Authorization System an example of?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Enterprise Environmental Factor"},{key:"B",text:"Organizational Process Assets"},{key:"C",text:"Tool and Technique"},{key:"D",text:"Process Steps"}],answer:{key:"A",text:"Enterprise Environmental Factor"},explanation:"The Work Authorization System, which outlines the process for work authorization including documents, tracking systems, and approval levels, is an example of an Enterprise Environmental Factor. These factors are external to the project team and influence their choices and actions, encompassing processes and practices that affect the project's execution."},{question:"Which tool is indicative of a business analyst's extent of involvement in managing product scope?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Requirement Traceability Matrix"},{key:"B",text:"Impact Analysis"},{key:"C",text:"Dependency Analysis"},{key:"D",text:"Value Analysis"}],answer:{key:"A",text:"Requirement Traceability Matrix"},explanation:"The Requirement Traceability Matrix serves as a clear indicator of a business analyst's involvement in product scope management. While project managers handle project scope, business analysts focus on product scope. The traceability process of requirements exemplifies this involvement. As requirements are approved, corresponding work products across various phases are created, ensuring that no gaps exist between what is approved and what is built or tested. The Requirement Traceability Matrix assists in monitoring these relationships and is thus pivotal in understanding the breadth of a business analyst's involvement in tracking approved requirements and their associated work products."},{question:"In a situation where David, a business analyst, notices that certain design documents are missing in relation to approved requirements, and the business value of these requirements has diminished during development, what should his next step be?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Dismiss the approved requirements due to their low current business value"},{key:"B",text:"Instruct the team to immediately create the missing work products"},{key:"C",text:"Decide whether to cancel the approved requirements or create the missing work products later, based on current business value"},{key:"D",text:"Escalate the issue to the project sponsor"}],answer:{key:"C",text:"Decide whether to cancel the approved requirements or create the missing work products later, based on current business value"},explanation:"When discrepancies between approved requirements and the developed work products are discovered, a business analyst should evaluate whether to cancel or defer the requirements, or create the missing work products. This decision should be informed by the current business value of these requirements. If canceling them adds more value to the overall business objectives, the analyst should proceed accordingly, as outlined in the business analysis planning, which specifies the authority for requirement cancellation. In some cases, creating work products for low-value requirements might still be necessary due to other dependencies, necessitating a re-prioritization and scheduling of these tasks."},{question:"Which strategy is effective in preventing scope creep?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Ensure every work product is listed as a requirement attribute in the requirement traceability matrix"},{key:"B",text:"Guarantee each work product is linked back to an approved requirement"},{key:"C",text:"Involve stakeholders in maintaining the requirement traceability matrix"},{key:"D",text:"Utilize requirement traceability during impact analysis for change requests"}],answer:{key:"B",text:"Guarantee each work product is linked back to an approved requirement"},explanation:"To prevent scope creep, which is the uncontrolled expansion of project or product scope without corresponding adjustments in resources, time, and costs, it's crucial to continuously verify that each work product is directly linked to an approved requirement. This linkage ensures that all work aligns with the defined scope. Including every work product as a requirement attribute in the requirement traceability matrix can lead to excessive tracking and isn't a practical approach. While stakeholder involvement in maintaining the traceability matrix is beneficial, it's primarily the responsibility of the business analyst. Using requirement traceability for impact analysis is helpful, but directly linking work products to approved requirements is a more effective way to control scope creep."},{question:"Which statement is false regarding the relationships between requirements in a traceability matrix?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Requirement relationships evolve over time."},{key:"B",text:"A requirement can be part of another requirement."},{key:"C",text:"Some requirements rely on the implementation of others before they can be implemented."},{key:"D",text:"Monitoring requirement relationships helps assess the development team's strength."}],answer:{key:"D",text:"Monitoring requirement relationships helps assess the development team's strength."},explanation:"Requirements are often interconnected, meaning that some cannot be fulfilled without others. Dependency analysis is a tool used to identify these connections. In a traceability matrix, requirements are organized by grouping dependent ones together. Examples of dependencies include subset relationships, implementation dependencies, and benefit/value dependencies. The traceability matrix also ensures that newly detailed requirements are linked back to baseline requirements. The purpose of monitoring requirement relationships is to oversee product scope, not to evaluate the development team's strength."},{question:"What does the requirements life cycle represent?",options:[{key:"A",text:"The stages a requirement goes through during a project."},{key:"B",text:"The stages a product goes through during a project."},{key:"C",text:"The stages a project goes through during its lifecycle."},{key:"D",text:"The stages a team goes through during a project."}],answer:{key:"A",text:"The stages a requirement goes through during a project."},explanation:"The traceability matrix tracks the status or state of requirements, indicating their position in the requirements life cycle. This cycle represents the various stages a requirement undergoes as it is managed throughout the project. It is distinct from the project life cycle."},{question:"As a business analyst collaborating with a project team to identify evaluation metrics, what should be utilized for defining these metrics?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Collaborating further with Subject Matter Experts."},{key:"B",text:"Recognizing adequate test coverage of requirements."},{key:"C",text:"Linking project goals and objectives with supporting requirements."},{key:"D",text:"Comparing metrics with those from similar projects."}],answer:{key:"C",text:"Linking project goals and objectives with supporting requirements."},explanation:"Formal traceability matrices help verify that requirements support business goals and objectives and ensure comprehensive testing coverage. The connections between project goals, objectives, and their supporting requirements offer insights into appropriate metrics for evaluation. While collaborating with subject matter experts and recognizing test coverage are useful, linking requirements to goals and objectives is essential for defining relevant metrics."},{question:"As a business analyst in a project developing a waste pickup mobile application, why is it important to evaluate test results using quality assurance tools and techniques during solution evaluation?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Solution evaluation involves end-user testing, necessitating test repetition."},{key:"B",text:"Different metrics used in solution evaluation necessitate test result reevaluation."},{key:"C",text:"Stakeholder sign-off requires test result evaluation as evidence."},{key:"D",text:"To identify potential anomalies in a larger dataset."}],answer:{key:"D",text:"To identify potential anomalies in a larger dataset."},explanation:"Evaluating a software solution typically occurs in a system ready for or already released. This evaluation involves testing with a larger dataset than initial testing, potentially revealing new data anomalies. These anomalies must be analyzed. Solution evaluation does not imply test repetition by business users or solely focus on alignment with the business case. While stakeholder sign-off is important, the primary reason for solution evaluation using quality assurance tools is to uncover anomalies from a larger body of data."}]},null,8,["qas"])])}const k=i(l,[["render",u]]);export{v as __pageData,k as default};
