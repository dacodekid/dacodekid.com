This can relate to processes, resources, market position, and so on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resulting Impact</strong>: This spells out the consequences of the situation, often in terms of business value, such as costs, benefits, or risks.</p></li></ol><h3 id="purpose" tabindex="-1">Purpose <a class="header-anchor" href="#purpose" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Purpose&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The situation statement aims to serve as a consolidated, concise presentation of the issue or opportunity at hand. It becomes a touchpoint that the business analysis activities can refer back to. Here are some key purposes it serves:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Ensures that all stakeholders and team members have a unified understanding of what is being addressed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comparison against Current State</strong>: The situation statement becomes a baseline against which the current state of the organization can be assessed to gauge the impact of the situation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Starting Point for Future State</strong>: It establishes the context for what exists today and provides a foundational base from which the future state of the organization can be built.</p></li></ul><h3 id="flexibility-in-format" tabindex="-1">Flexibility in Format <a class="header-anchor" href="#flexibility-in-format" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Flexibility in Format&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While a situation statement has these foundational elements, the format can vary depending on organizational preferences.

When assessing the current state, the situation statement helps identify gaps or issues that need to be addressed to transition to a desired future state. This future state is then designed to solve or exploit the defined problem or opportunity.</p><p>Situation Statement is a critical tool in business analysis. It crystallizes the problem or opportunity, aligns the team and stakeholders, provides a comparison baseline for assessing the current state, and lays the foundation for planning the future state. It thereby enables more effective and targeted business analysis activities.</p>',13),o=[i];function r(l,u,h,p,d,c){return e(),a("div",null,o)}const g=t(n,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
