This process involves supplementing user stories with additional information until they achieve a level of detail sufficient for the development teams to commence work. In essence, story elaboration serves as a bridge between high-level user stories and the more detailed functional and nonfunctional requirements that development teams need to build the solution effectively.</p><h3 id="user-stories-as-promises-for-conversation" tabindex="-1">User Stories as Promises for Conversation <a class="header-anchor" href="#user-stories-as-promises-for-conversation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;User Stories as Promises for Conversation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In adaptive approaches, user stories often start at a higher level of abstraction compared to functional and nonfunctional requirements. They are generally treated as promises for further conversation rather than as rigid requirement statements. These conversations can take place verbally, with minimal documentation, provided the essential information is transferred to the team members who will be executing the work.</p><h3 id="adding-details-just-in-time" tabindex="-1">Adding Details &quot;Just in Time&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-details-just-in-time" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Adding Details &quot;Just in Time&quot;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Story elaboration is done &quot;just in time,&quot; meaning that details are added to the user stories only when they are about to enter the development stage. This approach aligns with the adaptive methodologies&#39; emphasis on flexibility and responsiveness to change. Introducing too much detail too early could hamper the development team&#39;s ability to negotiate priorities with business stakeholders and adapt to changing requirements.</p><h3 id="components-of-story-elaboration" tabindex="-1">Components of Story Elaboration <a class="header-anchor" href="#components-of-story-elaboration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Components of Story Elaboration&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The story elaboration process can incorporate a range of activities and artifacts, depending on what is deemed necessary for understanding and implementing the user story. These can include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Conversations with Business Stakeholders</strong>: Direct dialogues to understand the business context, objectives, and constraints.</p></li><li><p><strong>Writing Narratives</strong>: Detailed narratives that flesh out the user stories can be written to provide additional context.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design Decisions</strong>: Information about the design aspects may be incorporated into the story elaboration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wireframes and Analysis Models</strong>: Visual aids and models like wireframes may be created to give more depth to the user story.</p></li><li><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>: Explicitly defining the acceptance criteria is crucial for mutual understanding between business stakeholders and development teams. They are often accompanied by concrete examples.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business Rules, Issues, Constraints, and Dependencies</strong>: These are also documented as needed to provide a comprehensive view of what the implementation of the user story entails.</p></li></ul><h3 id="mutual-agreement" tabindex="-1">Mutual Agreement <a class="header-anchor" href="#mutual-agreement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mutual Agreement&quot;">​</a></h3><p>One of the key outcomes of story elaboration is the establishment of a mutual agreement between business stakeholders and development teams. This agreement is around what exactly is required for the user story and how everyone will know once the requirement has been successfully met. The acceptance criteria serve as the yardstick for this mutual agreement.</p><p>Story Elaboration is a nuanced and essential process in adaptive methodologies that ensures user stories are sufficiently detailed to move into the development phase, thereby facilitating a more effective and responsive project lifecycle.</p>',12),n=[i];function r(l,d,c,h,u,m){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const b=e(s,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
