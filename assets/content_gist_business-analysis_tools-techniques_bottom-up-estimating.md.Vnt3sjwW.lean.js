Each of these tasks is estimated individually in terms of duration, resources, or cost, and then these estimates are aggregated to provide a total estimate for the project or larger work package.<br><br>"},{id:3508,question:"How does Decomposition play a role in Bottom-Up Estimating?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"It provides a financial breakdown of the project."},{key:"B",text:"It involves breaking down the project into smaller, individual tasks or components for detailed estimation."},{key:"C",text:"It focuses on the legal aspects of project tasks."},{key:"D",text:"It outlines the technical specifications for each task."}],answer:"B",explanation:"In Bottom-Up Estimating, Decomposition is a crucial step that involves breaking down the larger work package or project scope into smaller, individual tasks or components. This is often done using decomposition models like Work Breakdown Structures (WBS). The decomposition allows for a more detailed and accurate estimation of each component.<br><br>"},{id:3509,question:"What is a key benefit of the Bottom-Up Estimating technique?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"It provides a detailed financial plan for the project."},{key:"B",text:"It offers high accuracy due to individual estimation of each task."},{key:"C",text:"It serves as a legal validation of project tasks."},{key:"D",text:"It focuses on the technical evaluation of project tasks."}],answer:"B",explanation:"A key benefit of the Bottom-Up Estimating technique is its high accuracy. This accuracy is achieved because each lower-level task is estimated individually, considering all the specific factors such as time, resources, and cost involved.
