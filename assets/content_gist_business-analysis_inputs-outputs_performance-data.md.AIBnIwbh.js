They are evaluated before and after a release to calculate the change in performance, which is subsequently translated into business value.</p><h3 id="baseline-data" tabindex="-1">Baseline Data <a class="header-anchor" href="#baseline-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Baseline Data&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Any prior performance data from a previous version of the product or from a manual process serve as a baseline.

However, in cases where this is not feasible, proxy metrics may be employed. These could include indicators like the average duration to complete a task using the product, software response times, or the count of errors made during a task.</p><h2 id="source-of-data-collection" tabindex="-1">Source of Data Collection <a class="header-anchor" href="#source-of-data-collection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Source of Data Collection&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Performance data are usually obtained from the business area responsible for the solution or through built-in instrumentation within the product itself. Other external means like surveys or focus groups post-release can also be utilized to gather performance data.</p><p>In essence, performance data act as a critical metric for business analysts and decision-makers to evaluate the success and impact of a solution.
