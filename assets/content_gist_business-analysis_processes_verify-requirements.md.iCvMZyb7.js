Meeting these standards aids in efficient communication of the requirements to all stakeholders and ensures that the final product meets the desired quality.</p><h3 id="key-definitions" tabindex="-1">Key Definitions <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-definitions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Definitions&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Verification:</strong> This is the act of reviewing the requirements and other product-related information to identify errors, contradictions, and conformity with quality standards. It assesses if the said requirements and product information adhere to a particular regulation, specification, or any imposed condition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Validation:</strong> While verification deals with the adherence of requirements to defined standards, validation is concerned with confirming that a product caters to the needs and desires of the customer and other pinpointed stakeholders.</p></li></ol><h3 id="notable-points-about-verification" tabindex="-1">Notable Points about Verification <a class="header-anchor" href="#notable-points-about-verification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Notable Points about Verification&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Iterative Process:</strong> Verification can be carried out in multiple iterations and doesn&#39;t necessarily follow a linear path.</p></li><li><p><strong>Formality Levels:</strong> Depending on the techniques applied, verification can be formal or informal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scope:</strong> Both requirements and related analysis models undergo verification and validation processes. This procedure can be executed on product information, whether at the portfolio, program, or project dimensions. The process might focus on a single requirement, an individual model, or a comprehensive set of product information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aim:</strong> The main goal of verification is to confirm that requirements and other product data are appropriately structured. It ensures models are lucid enough to be efficiently utilized. When it comes to non-functional requirements or acceptance criteria, verification assesses if these components can be effectively measured. Ultimately, verified requirements are more comprehensible, increasing the chances of successful implementation by the project team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Author Verification:</strong> While the author of the materials can carry out some preliminary verification, it&#39;s vital to have an external verification for unbiased scrutiny. This could be conducted by another business analyst not involved in the current project or other project team members.</p></li><li><p><strong>Review Against Standards:</strong> The person responsible for verification contrasts the requirements and other product-related information against any established analysis, compliance, or regulatory standards. This is done to confirm accuracy and alignment with the relevant standards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Outcome of Verification:</strong> Should the product information fail to meet the verification criteria, it necessitates further detailing or rephrasing. This is done to certify that it achieves a satisfactory quality level to progress in its life cycle. One way to evaluate this quality, especially when standards are absent or in conjunction with them, involves the 3Cs evaluation: ensuring the information is correct, complete, and consistent. Moreover, analysis models can be contrasted against established syntax or modeling standards for verification.</p></li></ul><p>By diligently following the &quot;Verify Requirements&quot; process, organizations can ensure that their requirements are clear, comprehensive, and in alignment with organizational standards, leading to successful project outcomes.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="product-scope" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Product Scope</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#product-scope" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Product scope refers to the features and functions that are to be included in a product or service.
