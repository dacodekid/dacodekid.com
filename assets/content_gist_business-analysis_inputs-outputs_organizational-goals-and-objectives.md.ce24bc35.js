They help in shaping the focus and parameters of business analysis activities, in addition to guiding decision-making processes related to program and project selection.</p><h3 id="organizational-goals" tabindex="-1">Organizational Goals <a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-goals" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Organizational Goals&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Organizational goals are measurable targets that a business sets to achieve its overarching strategy. These are generally long-term in nature, often spanning one or more years. The goals are broad-based, serving as a directional compass for where the organization aims to go.</p><h3 id="organizational-objectives" tabindex="-1">Organizational Objectives <a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-objectives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Organizational Objectives&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In contrast, organizational objectives are more specific action-oriented statements designed to enable the realization of organizational goals. These objectives are short-term, typically with durations of one year or less, and they serve as actionable steps toward achieving broader goals.</p><h3 id="interplay-between-goals-and-objectives" tabindex="-1">Interplay between Goals and Objectives <a class="header-anchor" href="#interplay-between-goals-and-objectives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Interplay between Goals and Objectives&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Goals and objectives function in a hierarchical and interrelated manner, where objectives serve to enable the attainment of goals. In essence, the objectives are the building blocks that contribute to the achievement of organizational goals.</p><h3 id="role-in-decision-making" tabindex="-1">Role in Decision Making <a class="header-anchor" href="#role-in-decision-making" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Role in Decision Making&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Both goals and objectives serve as criteria for decision-making within an organization.

This information is typically found in internal corporate strategy documents and business plans. These documents can offer insights into various dimensions such as industry trends, market conditions, competition, existing product lines, and potential new products.</p><h3 id="absence-of-documents" tabindex="-1">Absence of Documents <a class="header-anchor" href="#absence-of-documents" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Absence of Documents&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In cases where such strategy documents or plans are not available for review, interviews with stakeholders may be conducted to gather this critical information. This is especially true when performing current state analysis, as understanding the existing organizational goals and objectives can provide a foundation upon which to identify gaps, opportunities, or problems.</p><p>Organizational Goals and Objectives not only give direction to the activities of the business analysis but also play a pivotal role in aligning these activities with the broader strategic aims of the organization. Therefore, they are foundational elements that every business analyst must understand and consider in their practice.</p><h2 id="organizational-vs-business" tabindex="-1">Organizational vs. Business <a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-vs-business" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Organizational vs. Business&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the context of the PMI Guide to Business Analysis, Organizational Goals and Objectives and Business Goals and Objectives serve as strategic and operational guideposts, but they differ mainly in scope, level of detail, and the specific contexts in which they are applied.</p><h3 id="organizational-goals-and-objectives-1" tabindex="-1">Organizational Goals and Objectives <a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-goals-and-objectives-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Organizational Goals and Objectives&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Scope</strong>: Organizational goals and objectives typically pertain to the organization as a whole. They are integral to the company&#39;s overarching strategy and serve as the guiding light for all organizational activities.</li><li><strong>Detail Level</strong>: Organizational goals are broad and high-level, often long-term in nature. Objectives are more specific but aligned to facilitate the attainment of these broad goals.</li><li><strong>Context</strong>: These are often found in corporate strategy documents and business plans and are aimed at an audience that includes a wide range of stakeholders, from executives to employees to perhaps even external shareholders.</li><li><strong>Decision-making</strong>: Organizational goals and objectives provide the criteria for making strategic decisions, such as entering new markets, diversifying product lines, or pursuing specific programs and projects.</li></ul><h3 id="business-goals-and-objectives" tabindex="-1">Business Goals and Objectives <a class="header-anchor" href="#business-goals-and-objectives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Business Goals and Objectives&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Scope</strong>: Business goals and objectives are often more department-specific or project-specific. They usually align with a particular business unit or function within the organization.</li><li><strong>Detail Level</strong>: Like organizational objectives, business objectives are specific and short-term but are usually more tactical, aimed at achieving more immediate outcomes.</li><li><strong>Context</strong>: These are often articulated in business plans that are more narrowly focused than organizational strategy documents, aimed at business unit managers, team leaders, or project managers.</li><li><strong>Decision-making</strong>: Business goals and objectives are used to guide operational or tactical decisions. They could include things like increasing the efficiency of a particular process, reaching a sales target for a specific period, or successfully completing a project.</li></ul><h3 id="interrelationship" tabindex="-1">Interrelationship <a class="header-anchor" href="#interrelationship" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Interrelationship&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It&#39;s important to note that business goals and objectives should be aligned with the organizational goals and objectives. This ensures that the actions of individual business units or projects are in service of the larger organizational strategy.</p><p>In summary, while both organizational and business goals and objectives serve to guide activities and decision-making, they differ in terms of their scope, level of detail, context, and application in decision-making processes. Organizational goals and objectives are more strategic and overarching, whereas business goals and objectives are often more tactical and operational, linked to specific business units or projects.</p>',24),o=[s];function r(l,c,d,g,h,u){return a(),i("div",null,o)}const m=e(t,[["render",r]]);export{b as __pageData,m as default};
