They are particularly useful for various analytical activities, including the assessment of the current state, identification of capabilities, evaluation of options, and stakeholder identification.</p>',11),r=[a];function o(l,c,u,h,d,p){return t(),s("div",null,r)}const m=e(n,[["render",o]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
