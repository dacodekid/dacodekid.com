It can either be a subplan of the portfolio, program, or project management plan, or it can exist as a standalone document. The plan is an assembly of various sub-approaches that span all Knowledge Areas, effectively encapsulating the complete approach to business analysis within the scope of the initiative.</p><h3 id="components-of-business-analysis-plan" tabindex="-1">Components of Business Analysis Plan <a class="header-anchor" href="#components-of-business-analysis-plan" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Components of Business Analysis Plan&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Business Analysis Approach</strong>: It details the methodology and approach that will be followed for business analysis activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>: The plan outlines how stakeholders will be involved and the level of their engagement throughout the business analysis process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Requirements Management</strong>: While the business analysis plan is broader in scope, it still includes decisions about how requirements will be managed.
