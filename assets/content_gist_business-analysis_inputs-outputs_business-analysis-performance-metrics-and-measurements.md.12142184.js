Metrics are the qualitative or quantitative measures used to assess how well the business analysis processes and activities are performing.</p><h3 id="types-of-metrics" tabindex="-1">Types of Metrics <a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-metrics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Types of Metrics&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are several types of metrics to consider:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Effectiveness Metrics</strong>: These relate to the usage and perception of the effectiveness of business analysis practices. They gauge how well the BA practices are perceived and used.</p></li><li><p><strong>Requirement-Related Metrics</strong>: These metrics focus on the quality and stability of requirements. Problems with requirements often indicate underlying issues with business analysis practices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Effort and Duration Metrics</strong>: Large variances in the actual level of effort, duration, or degree of completion for business analysis activities can indicate the need for improvement.</p></li></ol><h3 id="examples-of-metrics" tabindex="-1">Examples of Metrics <a class="header-anchor" href="#examples-of-metrics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Examples of Metrics&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Percentage of all defects that are requirements defects</li><li>Percentage of missed requirements</li><li>Number of missed business objectives</li><li>Percentage of unstable, volatile requirements</li><li>Average time to obtain customer acceptance on requirements</li><li>Percentage of teams conducting lessons learned where BA practices are discussed</li><li>Slippage in delivery dates for BA deliverables</li><li>Number of open issues or questions about the requirements</li><li>Number of comments from stakeholders expressing dissatisfaction</li><li>KPIs and service-level agreements (if defined)</li></ul><h3 id="calculations-and-agreements" tabindex="-1">Calculations and Agreements <a class="header-anchor" href="#calculations-and-agreements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Calculations and Agreements&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The team should reach a consensus on how these metrics will be measured and any calculations that will be used. For example, to calculate the &quot;percentage of missed requirements,&quot; the number of requirements identified after a certain point can be compared to the total number of requirements up to that point.</p><h3 id="adaptive-approaches" tabindex="-1">Adaptive Approaches <a class="header-anchor" href="#adaptive-approaches" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Adaptive Approaches&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In adaptive life cycles, the lack of stability in requirements or user stories is a particularly valuable metric. The expectation is that stability should increase as the project proceeds.</p><h3 id="cautions" tabindex="-1">Cautions <a class="header-anchor" href="#cautions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cautions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It&#39;s important to interpret these metrics carefully. They often can&#39;t pinpoint poor business analysis practices as the sole cause of problems. Issues in other aspects of product development may be equal or even greater contributors.</p><h3 id="inputs-for-performance-assessment" tabindex="-1">Inputs for Performance Assessment <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs-for-performance-assessment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs for Performance Assessment&quot;">​</a></h3><p>These metrics can serve as important inputs to the Business Analysis Performance Assessment, allowing organizations to undertake a more holistic evaluation of their business analysis functions.</p><p>In summary, business analysis performance metrics and measurements offer a structured way to evaluate the success of business analysis activities. By tracking these metrics, organizations can identify areas for improvement, thereby contributing to the overall effectiveness and value of business analysis within the organization.</p>',16),r=[n];function o(c,l,u,m,p,f){return s(),a("div",null,r)}const b=e(i,[["render",o]]);export{h as __pageData,b as default};
