This information can be captured using various means like whiteboards, flipcharts, meeting notes, and recording devices. However, raw elicitation results might contain inaccuracies, redundancies, and may lack organization. Hence, it&#39;s crucial to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Refine and Correct:</strong> Eliminate any irrelevant or extraneous information that doesn&#39;t contribute to the project&#39;s objectives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Organize and Categorize:</strong> Structure the information in a manner that&#39;s easy to understand and analyze.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consolidation:</strong> Combine similar pieces of information to avoid redundancy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comparison:</strong> Elicitation results should be compared with previously gathered information to identify any discrepancies. Any inconsistencies should be addressed in subsequent elicitation sessions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conversion to Formality:</strong> Based on the stakeholders&#39; requirements, the information may need to be presented in a more formal or informal manner.</p></li><li><p><strong>Packaging:</strong> Prepare the elicitation results in a manner suitable for distribution among stakeholders.</p></li></ol><h2 id="methods-of-confirming-elicitation-results" tabindex="-1">Methods of Confirming Elicitation Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#methods-of-confirming-elicitation-results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Methods of Confirming Elicitation Results&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There are various ways to confirm the accuracy of elicitation results:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Direct Distribution:</strong> Elicitation results can be sent back to the participants who provided the initial information. This allows them to review and confirm the accuracy of the details.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concurrent Confirmation:</strong> In some scenarios, it&#39;s feasible to confirm information during the elicitation process itself. This method, where elicitation and confirmation happen simultaneously, is prevalent in adaptive life cycles.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Choosing the Right Approach</strong></p><p>The effectiveness of the method chosen to confirm elicitation results can vary based on the situation. For instance:</p><ul><li><p>When key stakeholders send representatives instead of attending themselves, it might not be effective to confirm results during the elicitation process itself. The delegates might not have the authority or complete knowledge to validate the information.</p></li><li><p>On the other hand, a separate review and confirmation cycle could be inefficient if stakeholders are unwilling to allocate time post-elicitation for review and approval.</p></li></ul><p>It&#39;s essential for the team to discuss and reach a consensus on the method to review and confirm elicitation results.

One example is business rules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dependencies</strong>: These are contingent factors upon which requirements depend. They provide support or control the requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Issues</strong>: These are subjects or discussions related to requirements or other product data. It&#39;s crucial to document these and monitor them until they are resolved to ensure complete requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Product risks</strong>: These are potential events or conditions that might positively or negatively impact the product.

This comparison is grounded on several factors like the business&#39;s aspirations and aims, the anticipated costs linked with its implementation, its viability, the risks associated, and so forth. Post this rigorous assessment, recommendations pertaining to the design options in question are put forth. This procedure&#39;s paramount advantage is that it paves the way for well-informed suggestions concerning design choices.</p><h2 id="deep-dive" tabindex="-1">Deep Dive <a class="header-anchor" href="#deep-dive" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Deep Dive&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Venturing into the realm of product design isn&#39;t merely confined to the functionalities of the product. Rather, it delves deeper into its construction methodology and its aesthetic attributes. When it comes to crafting a solution, there&#39;s a plethora of alternatives to pick from. The role of business analysis becomes pivotal here, as it assists in evaluating these myriad options. This involves discerning the gamut of design choices at one&#39;s disposal and meticulously analyzing how these designs metamorphose into a concrete solution. The analytical outcomes corresponding to each option furnishes crucial details that elucidate the advantages, disadvantages, associated risks, and the financial implications of that particular choice. Every design alternative is juxtaposed with its counterparts to deduce which among them is the most congruent with the overarching product goals, constraints, financial stipulations, and temporal boundaries. Non-feasible designs are promptly eliminated from the list of contenders.</p><h2 id="design-deliberations" tabindex="-1">Design Deliberations <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-deliberations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design Deliberations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Initiating conversations around design is imperative prior to commencing the actual construction of a solution or even its components. This stands true irrespective of the magnitude of the solution fragment in question. Bypassing these vital deliberations could culminate in objectives being overlooked or in products that aren&#39;t user-friendly. Moreover, the development phase of the product might become prolonged if the teams are caught up in spontaneous design decision-making.</p><p>Product-centric teams aren&#39;t bound to defer their product design evaluations until the culmination of the requirements phase. This evaluative process can run parallelly as fragments of requirements crystallize into design. It&#39;s pivotal to rank these requirements hierarchically to ensure that the design resonates with the most pressing requirements. In scenarios where this procedure is executed in an iterative and incremental fashion, design paradigms might undergo alterations across iterations, triggering some modifications. In scenarios following adaptive life cycles, such modifications are factored in during the planning phase. On the contrary, in a predictive life cycle framework, the design undergoes changes post the completion of the requirements phase. As a consequence, these alterations exert a more pronounced impact, often escalating costs. Such ramifications are especially pronounced when they stem from insights garnered during the product&#39;s developmental trajectory.</p><h2 id="design-scope" tabindex="-1">Design Scope <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-scope" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design Scope&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Design ideologies and analyses aren&#39;t confined solely to projects.

The primary advantage of executing this process is to make well-informed determinations on the release of the whole or a segment of a solution, and whether there&#39;s a necessity for alterations, rectifications, or enhancements.</p><h2 id="understanding-the-process" tabindex="-1">Understanding the Process <a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-the-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Understanding the Process&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This procedure emphasizes contrasting the acceptance criteria with the acceptance testing results. The objective is to provide guidance on addressing instances where some facets of a solution might not meet its designated acceptance criteria. The scope of this testing can range from a comprehensive solution release to just a single business scenario, which could be derived from multiple user stories.</p><p>Notably, the emphasis is on the outcomes of the comparison rather than the tests themselves. This distinction aligns with the prevalent industry practice where roles involved in business analysis are separate from those handling testing. While the testing roles usually handle the pass/fail aspect, business analysis is crucial to gauge the scale and severity of defects, deduce their root cause, recognize associated risks, and put forth suggestions to rectify them. Within these recommendations, business impacts, repair costs, or workaround costs are assessed alongside the implications and costs of rolling out the solution without addressing existing defects.</p><h2 id="sources-of-test-results" tabindex="-1">Sources of Test Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#sources-of-test-results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sources of Test Results&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Test outcomes vital for evaluating acceptance criteria might originate from:</p><ul><li>Exploratory tests and user acceptance tests.</li><li>Day-in-the-life (DITL) tests.</li><li>Preproduction or simulated production testing.</li><li>Functionality tests within a scenario.</li><li>Nonfunctional requirements tests.
