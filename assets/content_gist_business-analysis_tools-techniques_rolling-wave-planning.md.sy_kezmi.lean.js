This concept aligns closely with rolling wave planning, allowing for a more adaptive and flexible planning process."},{question:"How is Rolling Wave Planning applied in an adaptive life cycle, such as Agile?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"By providing a financial forecast for each release, including budgeting and forecasting"},{key:"B",text:"By planning at the release level, determining features and functions for current or upcoming releases"},{key:"C",text:"By serving as a legal document for each release, outlining the legal implications of each release"},{key:"D",text:"By focusing solely on technical aspects for each release"}],answer:"B",explanation:'In an adaptive life cycle, like Agile, Rolling Wave Planning is applied at the release level. It aids in determining the features and functions that will be part of the current or upcoming release. Instead of planning every detail from the start, the planning occurs in "waves" as more information becomes available, aligning with the iterative nature of Agile frameworks.'},{question:"What is the role of the business analyst in Rolling Wave Planning?",choices:[{key:"A",text:"To provide a financial analysis for each phase of the project"},{key:"B",text:"To plan near-term tasks and prioritize features for upcoming releases."},{key:"C",text:"To focus on the legal compliance of project planning"},{key:"D",text:"To emphasize the technical development aspects in planning"}],answer:"B",explanation:"In Rolling Wave Planning, the business analyst plays a critical role. In a predictive life cycle, the analyst may be responsible for creating detailed plans for near-term business analysis tasks. In an adaptive life cycle, the analyst often works closely with the product owner and development team to prioritize features, functions, or epics for the upcoming release based on current information."}]},null,8,["quizData"])])}const v=a(l,[["render",c]]);export{y as __pageData,v as default};
