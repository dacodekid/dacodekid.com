This tool is often used during the Strategy Analysis phase or as part of Stakeholder Engagement to visually articulate how closely stakeholders are related to the solution. It falls under the visual modeling techniques in the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK).</p><h3 id="objective" tabindex="-1">Objective <a class="header-anchor" href="#objective" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objective&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The primary goal of an Onion Diagram is to analyze stakeholders by representing the strength or significance of their relationships to the solution. Stakeholders closest to the core of the onion have the most direct or strong relationship to the solution. Those on the outer layers have a less direct relationship. This information can be vital for stakeholder engagement strategies, defining requirements, and effective communication.</p><h3 id="structure" tabindex="-1">Structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Structure&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The diagram consists of concentric circles, resembling the layers of an onion. At the center, you place the solution which could represent one or multiple products. Each layer moving outward contains different stakeholders, grouped based on the strength or significance of their relationship to the solution.</p><h3 id="how-to-create" tabindex="-1">How to Create <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-create" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to Create&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Identify Solution</strong>: Place the solution or product at the center of the diagram.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identify Stakeholders</strong>: List all the stakeholders related to the solution, both internal and external to the organization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Classify Relationships</strong>: Determine the strength or significance of each stakeholder&#39;s relationship to the solution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Position Stakeholders</strong>: Place stakeholders in the concentric circles based on the classified relationship strength.
