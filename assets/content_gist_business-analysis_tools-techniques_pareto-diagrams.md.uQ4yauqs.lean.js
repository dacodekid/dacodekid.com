Since the data points are displayed in descending order of importance, it allows for an intuitive understanding of priority issues, and the diagram can often reveal that a significant percentage of problems are caused by a small number of root causes. This is in alignment with the 80/20 principle, which suggests that focusing on these few root causes can result in a large-scale improvement.",-1),u=e("p",null,"Pareto Diagrams are versatile and can be tailored to depict various kinds of information depending on the project needs.
