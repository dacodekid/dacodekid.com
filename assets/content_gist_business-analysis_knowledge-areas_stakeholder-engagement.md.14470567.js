It aims at ensuring a mutual understanding of the business analysis activities necessary to delineate the solution, followed by regular evaluations to guarantee the efficacy of the business analysis process.</p><h2 id="key-concepts" tabindex="-1">Key Concepts <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Concepts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Stakeholder Engagement revolves around the tasks carried out to comprehend the requirements and characteristics of stakeholders, ensuring the most effective ways to recognize, engage, communicate, and collaborate with them. Though not exclusive to business analysis, when executed within this discipline, the goal is to guarantee optimal stakeholder engagement throughout the business analysis processes.</p><p>A significant portion of business analysis pertains to communication. The Stakeholder Engagement processes emphasize the individuals or groups linked, either directly or indirectly, to the situation being analyzed or to the solution. Clarity regarding who should be included in the business analysis process, combined with concerted efforts to collaborate and adopt practices that are supportive, yields immense benefits not just for business analysis, but also for portfolio, program, and project management. Stakeholder Engagement, in essence, ensures maximum representation and sustained interest and participation from the stakeholder community.</p><hr><h2 id="identify-stakeholders" tabindex="-1">Identify Stakeholders <a class="header-anchor" href="#identify-stakeholders" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Identify Stakeholders&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The process of &quot;Identify Stakeholders&quot; revolves around pinpointing the individuals, groups, or organizations that have a potential impact, are impacted, or even think they might be impacted by the area being assessed.

They provide crucial inputs during requirements elicitation by delivering business analysis data. This data then forms the foundation for shaping product requirements. It&#39;s important to note that stakeholder identification is fluid. An individual or group that identifies or perceives themselves as a product stakeholder at the beginning might see their role or perception change as more details about the situation and product requirements unfold. As the solution progresses, product teams utilize the defined product scope and results from analysis to make necessary modifications to the list of stakeholders.

After estimating the tasks, they&#39;re organized into a fitting work plan.</p><p>In contrast, teams that use a change-driven, adaptive life cycle still consider business analysis tasks, effort levels, task durations, dependencies, constraints, and task sequencing. However, usually, business analysis effort and tasks aren&#39;t segregated for estimation and planning.</p><p>For an adaptive life cycle method, during a planning session at the release level, prioritization often emerges as the key planning criterion. When planning starts at the outset of every iteration, both prioritization and just-in-time estimating determine the product backlog items the team will commit to. Post this, these items are split into tasks. Some adaptive approach teams also segregate and estimate time for refining significant or intricate items that are part of the current iteration or are up next in a product backlog but haven&#39;t been fully understood to kickstart development.</p><p>Despite the distinctions in approaches, business analysis planning remains an integral part of product development, regardless of the life cycle model adopted.
