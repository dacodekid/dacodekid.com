It allows multiple people to collaborate on a single set of files, while maintaining a complete history of changes. VCS operates under the umbrella of a Configuration Management System (CMS) and can be considered one of the many functionalities that make up a complete CMS.</p><h3 id="key-components" tabindex="-1">Key Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Components&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Repository</strong>: Central storage where all versions of work products are stored.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commit</strong>: The act of saving changes to the repository. Each commit represents a snapshot of the work product at a point in time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Branch</strong>: A diverging stream of changes, separate from the main or default development path. Branches are often used for developing new features or for isolating changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Merge</strong>: The act of integrating changes from one branch into another.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tag</strong>: A named reference to a specific version within the repository, often used to capture milestones like releases.</p></li></ul><h3 id="key-features" tabindex="-1">Key Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Features&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Revision History</strong>: A detailed log of all changes made to the work product, including who made the change, what was changed, and why it was changed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concurrency Control</strong>: Allows multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously. VCS handles conflicts that arise when changes overlap.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rollback and Audit Trail</strong>: Provides the capability to revert to previous versions, facilitating easier debugging and allowing for an audit trail.</p></li><li><p><strong>Baseline Identification</strong>: Similar to CMS, VCS also allows for the creation of baselines which are essentially snapshots of the project at particular points in time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Atomic Operations</strong>: Changes are committed as a whole, ensuring that operations (like commits or updates) are atomic, meaning they either fully succeed or fail, leaving the repository in a consistent state.</p></li></ul><h3 id="usage-in-context" tabindex="-1">Usage in Context <a class="header-anchor" href="#usage-in-context" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Usage in Context&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In projects following a predictive life cycle, Version Control Systems are critical for managing changes to work products and ensuring alignment with project requirements. They support Configuration Management by tracking each version of a work product, thereby making it easier to assess the impact of changes, resolve conflicts, and distribute the latest version to team members.</p><p>By using a VCS, business analysts can maintain the integrity of work products, assure quality, and improve collaboration among team members, thereby contributing to the project’s overall success.</p>',9),i=[n];function r(l,c,h,p,g,m){return t(),o("div",null,i)}const f=e(a,[["render",r]]);export{d as __pageData,f as default};
