These models are instrumental in visually articulating how a particular solution aligns with and aims to achieve the overarching business objectives.</p><p><strong>Goal Models</strong>: These are specifically designed to show stakeholder goals for a particular solution. The model can indicate relationships between different goals, including those that may support or conflict with one another.</p><p><strong>Business Objectives Models</strong>: These models offer a decomposition of high-level business strategies into tangible business problems and objectives. They serve to visually represent the value proposition of a portfolio, program, or project and how a planned solution aims to fulfill these objectives. This could be in terms of increasing revenue, decreasing costs, or avoiding penalties.</p><p>Both Goal Models and Business Objectives Models are typically created at the inception of a program or project. However, they can be revisited and updated at any point, especially for the purpose of prioritization within a portfolio.</p><p><strong>Role in Feature Prioritization and Scope Management</strong>: One of the key functions of these models is to assist in feature prioritization. By laying out the business objectives and goals, these models provide a basis for determining which features are of utmost importance and should be prioritized for development.</p><p><strong>Alignment with Business Objectives</strong>: These models are often used to ensure that the requirements or user stories are in sync with the business objectives. They can act as a traceability matrix to map features or requirements back to specific business goals, thereby ensuring alignment.</p><p><strong>Collaboration with Project Management</strong>: It’s worth noting that the project manager can contribute to the completion of these models, especially if a cost-benefit analysis or business case has already been developed. Information from these analyses can feed into the goal and business objectives models to provide a more comprehensive view.</p><p>By facilitating a structured approach to defining and understanding business goals and objectives, these models are indispensable tools for business analysts in achieving alignment, aiding decision-making, and ensuring that the developed solution adds value to the business.</p>',9),a=[n];function r(l,d,c,p,u,h){return s(),o("div",null,a)}const g=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{b as __pageData,g as default};
