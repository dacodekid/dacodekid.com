It is the moment where all stakeholders come together to agree upon whether a particular solution, or part of a solution, is ready to be pushed into production. This step ensures that whatever is delivered meets the required standards and has been accepted by the necessary parties.</p><h2 id="purpose" tabindex="-1">Purpose <a class="header-anchor" href="#purpose" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Purpose&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The main objective of this process is to establish a clear demarcation between the development and release stages of a solution. Through this, stakeholders can be confident that what they&#39;ve agreed upon during development is what will be delivered.</p><h2 id="stakeholder-engagement" tabindex="-1">Stakeholder Engagement <a class="header-anchor" href="#stakeholder-engagement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stakeholder Engagement&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This process provides a platform for stakeholders who hold responsibility for the product to make decisions. They can decide if the solution should be:</p><ul><li>Released entirely</li><li>Released in parts</li><li>Not released at all</li></ul><p>The term &quot;release&quot; in the context of solution acceptance can have dual meanings:</p><ol><li>Releasing a solution or part of it into a production environment while still under the purview of its development team.</li><li>Transferring the solution or part of it to an operational area which will then assume responsibility for it.</li></ol><h2 id="basis-for-release-decisions" tabindex="-1">Basis for Release Decisions <a class="header-anchor" href="#basis-for-release-decisions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Basis for Release Decisions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The decision to release a solution predominantly depends on the following factors:</p><ul><li>The solution&#39;s acceptability, as determined by the assessed acceptance results.</li><li>Assurance that the organization is equipped and ready for the release.</li><li>Verification that all the preparatory activities for the release have been adequately completed. This encompasses harmonizing this solution release with any other simultaneous releases.</li><li>Acceptance of any lingering product risks and the possible solutions or workarounds to address those risks.</li></ul><p>An additional consideration is the warranty period.

The nature of this sign-off, whether formal or informal, is influenced by the organizational norms and the type of project life cycle:</p><ul><li><strong>Iterative or Adaptive Project Life Cycle</strong>: Typically, an informal sign-off happens at the close of each sprint or iteration. A formal sign-off, when mandated, is obtained before each solution release into the production setting.</li><li><strong>Predictive Project Life Cycle</strong>: Here, the sign-off usually takes place towards the end of the project life cycle. This can be either just before the release into production or after the release once the warranty period has concluded.</li></ul><p>The process of obtaining solution acceptance for release ensures that all stakeholders are in agreement, and the solution meets the organizational requirements before it&#39;s delivered into a production environment.</p><h2 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="product-scope" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/product-scope.html">Product Scope</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#product-scope" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/product-scope.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The Product Scope is a critical input in the process of establishing relationships and dependencies.
