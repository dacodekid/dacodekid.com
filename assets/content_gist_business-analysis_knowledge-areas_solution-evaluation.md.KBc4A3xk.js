It encompasses the measures and activities conducted to ascertain whether a proposed or implemented solution has met the outlined business requirements and delivers the expected value to the stakeholders.</p><h2 id="key-concepts" tabindex="-1">Key Concepts <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Concepts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The primary objective of the Solution Evaluation activities is to confirm whether a solution has met its expected business results. These practices can be applied broadly, from evaluating specific user scenarios to assessing overarching business outcomes.</p><p>Evaluation consists of comparing actual results from solution testing against the expected values as outlined by acceptance criteria. Over time, this practice helps determine if the projected business value of the solution has been realized.</p><p>There are various methods of evaluation. For instance, results from surveys or exploratory testing provide qualitative insights. Conversely, more quantitative evaluations can involve direct data examination from the solution. Nonfunctional attributes, like performance standards set in service agreements, can also be quantitatively measured.</p><p>Evaluations can take place:</p><ul><li>When decisions need to be made about releasing a solution or a part of it.</li><li>Shortly after deploying a solution or segment, like post-warranty.</li><li>After a significant period post-deployment to get a long-term understanding of its business impact.</li></ul><p>To effectively conduct Solution Evaluation, preparatory activities are essential. This includes clearly defining the anticipated business value, identifying performance data types, ensuring data availability, and procuring baseline data.</p><p>Other points to consider include:</p><ul><li>Evaluations can identify new requirements or changes, which can lead to refining existing solutions or creating new ones.</li><li>It aids in making informed go/no-go decisions for solution release.</li><li>It can pinpoint when additional efforts for a solution no longer justify the potential added value.</li><li>Identified solution limitations can drive a plethora of follow-up actions, from performance enhancement recommendations to the solution replacement or retirement.</li><li>Evaluations can inform decisions related to product developments or enhancements at the portfolio and program management levels.</li></ul><p>However, evaluating a solution is not without challenges:</p><ul><li>Some benefits might seem intangible and hard to measure. In such cases, indirect measures might be necessary to prove that these benefits have been realized.</li><li>Data required for evaluation might not be essential for the solution, potentially increasing solution development costs.</li><li>Some solution benefits might only be measurable long after its release. Responsibility for measuring these benefits might fall on the business area overseeing the product or an organizational domain.</li></ul><h2 id="processes" tabindex="-1">Processes <a class="header-anchor" href="#processes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Processes&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="evaluate-solution-performance" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/evaluate-solution-performance.html">Evaluate Solution Performance</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#evaluate-solution-performance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Evaluate Solution Performance](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/evaluate-solution-performance.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><h3 id="determine-solution-evaluation-approach" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/determine-solution-evaluation-approach.html">Determine Solution Evaluation Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#determine-solution-evaluation-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Determine Solution Evaluation Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/determine-solution-evaluation-approach.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><h3 id="evaluate-acceptance-results-and-address-defects" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/evaluate-acceptance-results-and-address-defects.html">Evaluate Acceptance Results and Address Defects</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#evaluate-acceptance-results-and-address-defects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Evaluate Acceptance Results and Address Defects](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/evaluate-acceptance-results-and-address-defects.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><h3 id="obtain-solution-acceptance-for-release" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/obtain-solution-acceptance-for-release.html">Obtain Solution Acceptance for Release</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#obtain-solution-acceptance-for-release" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Obtain Solution Acceptance for Release](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/obtain-solution-acceptance-for-release.md)&quot;">​</a></h3>',18),i=[o];function l(r,c,u,d,p,h){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const v=e(n,[["render",l]]);export{f as __pageData,v as default};
