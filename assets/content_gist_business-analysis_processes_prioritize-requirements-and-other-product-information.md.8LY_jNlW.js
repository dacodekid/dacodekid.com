Using this comprehension, along with other agreed-upon prioritization elements, the requirements and work are ranked. The primary advantages include aligning all involved parties on how the requirements achieve objectives and deciding the distribution of requirements across iterations or releases.</p><h3 id="significance" tabindex="-1">Significance <a class="header-anchor" href="#significance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Significance&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Scope Management:</strong> Managing product scope is essential, and prioritizing requirements is a crucial step in this management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Determining Order of Work:</strong> It establishes the sequence in which tasks should be performed to realize business objectives in a manner that aligns with the organization&#39;s needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Focus on Value:</strong> The essence of prioritization is centering on what delivers the utmost value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level of Prioritization:</strong> Any level of product data, from overarching business needs to specific functional requirements, is subject to prioritization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supporting Release Planning:</strong> Prioritization aids in assigning requirements to specific iterations or releases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Factors for Prioritization:</strong> Requirements and other product specifics, like issues or defects, are ranked based on factors such as their value, cost, complexity, compliance with regulations, and associated risks.</p></li></ul><h3 id="role" tabindex="-1">Role <a class="header-anchor" href="#role" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Role&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While business analysts may propose prioritization, it is pivotal for stakeholders possessing the requisite authority to be actively involved in this process. Business analysts:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Facilitate and Negotiate:</strong> They play a crucial role in aiding and mediating prioritization decisions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Setting Expectations:</strong> Early on in the business analysis process, it&#39;s essential to set stakeholder expectations about the prioritization methodology. This proactive approach prevents potential conflicts when some requirements are ranked lower.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skills Utilized:</strong> Negotiation, conflict resolution, and facilitation are vital skills employed during prioritization dialogues.</p></li></ul><h3 id="prioritization-timings-and-iterations" tabindex="-1">Prioritization Timings and Iterations <a class="header-anchor" href="#prioritization-timings-and-iterations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Prioritization Timings and Iterations&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The prioritization might be done in iterations or at once, and this is influenced by the project&#39;s life cycle. It determines the prioritization&#39;s regularity, timing, and the methods employed.</p><h3 id="two-pronged-effort" tabindex="-1">Two-Pronged Effort <a class="header-anchor" href="#two-pronged-effort" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Two-Pronged Effort&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Generally, prioritization involves two main steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Business Stakeholder Prioritization:</strong> Here, business stakeholders, subject matter experts, or product owners rank requirements based on perceived business value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Team Assessment:</strong> The second step involves the project team gauging the effort and risk associated with each requirement. The business analyst guides these discussions and collaborates with the team to ensure that top-priority requirements align with the project&#39;s boundaries.</p></li></ol><h3 id="fluidity" tabindex="-1">Fluidity <a class="header-anchor" href="#fluidity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fluidity&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It&#39;s worth noting that prioritization outcomes aren&#39;t set in stone. As the project unfolds, the importance of requirements can shift. Factors that influence prioritization can evolve, and requirements can be modified. The project&#39;s life cycle provides guidance on managing these priority shifts. Changes in priority, or the introduction of new requirements, are meticulously tracked and communicated to relevant stakeholders. Typically, validation precedes prioritization, but both processes can occur simultaneously. Different approaches have varying sequences. In adaptive methodologies, high-level features might be initially prioritized, followed by user stories. Conversely, in predictive methodologies, the entire set of requirements is likely finalized and validated prior to prioritization.</p><h3 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="elicitation-approach" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Elicitation Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#elicitation-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Elicitation Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The analysis approach serves as a structured method for carrying out business analysis tasks.
