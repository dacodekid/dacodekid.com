Typically, the timebox serves as a constraint under which the team identifies the most critical work items to complete. This is usually accomplished using a second prioritization scheme, such as MoSCoW (Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves), Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF), or business value points to rank the requirements.
