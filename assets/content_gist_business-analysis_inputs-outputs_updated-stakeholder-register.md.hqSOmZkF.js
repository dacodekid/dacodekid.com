This document serves as a central repository for storing information about the stakeholders who have an interest or involvement in the project or product. Maintaining an up-to-date stakeholder register is pivotal to successful business analysis, as any oversight can lead to the loss of crucial product requirements.</p><h2 id="key-components" tabindex="-1">Key Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Components&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Names</strong>: One of the primary updates in this register is the addition or modification of stakeholder names. As the project progresses or changes, new stakeholders may become involved, or existing ones may change roles or exit the project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supporting Information</strong>: This includes various characteristics of stakeholders like their roles, responsibilities, interests, influence, and communication preferences, among others. This information is generally obtained through stakeholder analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Characterization</strong>: The register includes the characterization of stakeholders based on the stakeholder analysis.

For example, if a critical stakeholder is not adequately engaged, it could pose a risk to the project, which can be preemptively addressed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimal Engagement</strong>: Through the characterization of stakeholders, the register helps in assessing whether the engagement level and communication with a particular stakeholder are optimal at any given time.</p></li></ol><h2 id="periodic-updates" tabindex="-1">Periodic Updates <a class="header-anchor" href="#periodic-updates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Periodic Updates&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The stakeholder register is not a one-time document but needs periodic updating.
