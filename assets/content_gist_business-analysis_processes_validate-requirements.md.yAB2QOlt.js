It ensures the right solution is in development. The primary purpose is to ascertain that the solution will indeed cater to and support the business objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs). A potential consequence of neglecting validation is that the devised solution may fail to align with the business&#39;s objectives and needs, often because these needs were misunderstood.</p></li><li><p><strong>Verification</strong>, on the other hand, focuses on affirming that the product information adheres to specific standards and is articulately composed.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Levels of Validation</strong>:</p><ul><li>Validation is versatile and can be applied across different organizational strata, such as the portfolio, program, or project stages.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Iterative Validation</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>The validation process isn&#39;t always linear. It can be iterative, where specific requirements are periodically reassessed and validated. Alternatively, it can also be a cumulative process where a final batch of information is validated all at once.</p></li><li><p>Business objectives and goals are dynamic. As they evolve, it might necessitate corresponding adjustments to the requirements. These modified requirements will again need validation to ensure alignment with the changed business objectives.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Scope of Validation</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>The validation process is versatile. It can be applied to individual requirements, singular models, or an entire set of product information.</p></li><li><p>Both requirements and the connected requirement models undergo verification and validation.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Business Analyst&#39;s Role</strong>:</p><ul><li>A business analyst can independently conduct certain facets of the requirements validation using suitable analytical models. At this juncture, the validation is majorly centered on mapping the requirements and other product data to the business objectives. This exercise helps in pinpointing gaps, duplications, or inconsistencies.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Involvement</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>The bulk of the validation process calls for active stakeholder involvement. Stakeholders are tasked with reviewing the requirements and associated product details. Their feedback determines if the presented information is robust enough to facilitate the construction of the desired solution.</p></li><li><p>The iterative nature of validation might also lead to the discovery of new elements that require attention. This discovery can subsequently trigger further stages like elicitation, modeling, analysis, and elaboration.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>In essence, the Validate Requirements process serves as a crucial checkpoint in the business analysis domain. It ensures that the developing solution is in harmony with the business&#39;s aspirations, thus ensuring the solution&#39;s eventual success and acceptance among stakeholders.</p><hr><h2 id="validate-requirements-1" tabindex="-1">Validate Requirements: <a class="header-anchor" href="#validate-requirements-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Validate Requirements:&quot;">​</a></h2><h2 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="acceptance-criteria" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/acceptance-criteria.html">Acceptance Criteria</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#acceptance-criteria" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Acceptance Criteria](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/acceptance-criteria.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Acceptance criteria provide clear definitions on the conditions that must be met for a product, feature, or solution to be considered complete.
