An effective Elicitation Approach takes into account several factors to ensure a well-structured and efficient gathering of requirements.</p><h2 id="what-it-describes" tabindex="-1">What It Describes <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-it-describes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What It Describes&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>What Information to Elicit</strong>: Specifies the kind of data or requirements that need to be gathered. This could range from functional requirements to business rules, or any other information critical to the project&#39;s success.</p></li><li><p><strong>Where to Find Information</strong>: Identifies the sources from which this data will be gathered. These sources could be documentation, stakeholders, or systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to Obtain the Information</strong>: Lays out the techniques that will be used for elicitation. This could include interviews, document analysis, surveys, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>When to Conduct Elicitation</strong>: Plans the timing for when these elicitation activities will take place within the project timeline.</p></li></ol><h2 id="formality" tabindex="-1">Formality <a class="header-anchor" href="#formality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Formality&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Elicitation Approach can vary in its level of formality depending on the life cycle of the project. In more formal life cycles, it might be referred to as an &quot;elicitation plan&quot; and be well-documented. In less formal situations, it may exist as a thought process. Regardless of the level of formality, the essential decisions and thoughts that go into planning the elicitation activities should be communicated to the project team to ensure alignment and awareness.</p><h2 id="planning-and-preparation" tabindex="-1">Planning and Preparation <a class="header-anchor" href="#planning-and-preparation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Planning and Preparation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Good planning is crucial for the elicitation activities to provide value. Before conducting these activities, it&#39;s important to prepare, including identifying who the participants will be. The participant list can be derived from this planning effort.</p><h2 id="influence-on-analysis-approach" tabindex="-1">Influence on Analysis Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#influence-on-analysis-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Influence on Analysis Approach&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Elicitation Approach is not an isolated activity; it often informs the Analysis Approach. The types of elicitation techniques used and their corresponding outputs might influence which analysis techniques will be considered suitable. Moreover, the timing of the elicitation activities can impact when related analysis activities will take place.</p><h2 id="timing-and-concurrent-activities" tabindex="-1">Timing and Concurrent Activities <a class="header-anchor" href="#timing-and-concurrent-activities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Timing and Concurrent Activities&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It&#39;s important to note that elicitation does not have to be fully completed to start the analysis. Both activities are often performed in small increments and can be done concurrently. The timing for stakeholder involvement in the elicitation will affect when the analysis can be started based on the readiness of the elicitation outputs.</p><p>Elicitation Approach is a comprehensive plan that dictates how requirements will be gathered. It informs team members and stakeholders about what to expect and guides subsequent activities like analysis. It is a foundational element in the practice of Business Analysis and contributes significantly to the project&#39;s structure and efficiency.</p><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1">Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2>',14);function l(h,p,d,u,f,m){const e=i("QuizJS");return a(),n("div",null,[c,o(e,{quizData:[{id:100,question:"What is the primary purpose of an Elicitation Approach in a project?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"To define the project's marketing and sales strategies"},{key:"B",text:"To outline a plan for how requirement gathering will be conducted"},{key:"C",text:"To establish the financial budget for the project"},{key:"D",text:"To dictate the legal framework of the project"}],answer:"B",explanation:"The Elicitation Approach serves as a roadmap for conducting the requirement gathering process, outlining key aspects such as what information to gather, where to find it, how to obtain it, and when to conduct elicitation activities.<br><br>"},{id:101,question:"How does the Elicitation Approach impact the selection of analysis techniques in a project?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"It dictates the project's financial analysis techniques"},{key:"B",text:"The elicitation techniques used influence the choice of analysis techniques"},{key:"C",text:"It focuses solely on the technical architecture of the project"},{key:"D",text:"It only determines the project's communication strategy"}],answer:"B",explanation:"The types of elicitation techniques used in the Elicitation Approach can influence which analysis techniques are considered suitable, thereby impacting the overall Analysis Approach.<br><br>"},{id:102,question:"What does the Elicitation Approach typically specify about information gathering?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"The legal implications of information gathering"},{key:"B",text:"The kind of data or requirements to be gathered and the sources"},{key:"C",text:"The aesthetic aspects of the information gathered"},{key:"D",text:"The project's final deliverable specifications"}],answer:"B",explanation:"The Elicitation Approach specifies the kind of data or requirements that need to be gathered and identifies the sources from which this information will be collected.<br><br>"},{id:103,question:"In what way does the formality of the Elicitation Approach vary?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"It is always informally conducted as a thought process"},{key:"B",text:"It varies based on the life cycle of the project, from well-documented to a thought process"},{key:"C",text:"It is always a formally documented plan regardless of the project"},{key:"D",text:"It varies based on the project's budget"}],answer:"B",explanation:"The level of formality of the Elicitation Approach can vary depending on the project's life cycle, ranging from a well-documented plan in more formal life cycles to a thought process in less formal situations.<br><br>"},{id:104,question:"How is the timing of elicitation activities related to the start of analysis in a project?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"Elicitation must be fully completed before starting analysis"},{key:"B",text:"Elicitation and analysis are often performed concurrently in small increments"},{key:"C",text:"Analysis is always conducted prior to any elicitation activities"},{key:"D",text:"The timing of elicitation has no impact on the analysis phase"}],answer:"B",explanation:"Elicitation and analysis activities are often performed in small increments and can be done concurrently, with the timing of elicitation affecting when related analysis activities can start.<br>"}]},null,8,["quizData"])])}const b=t(r,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,b as default};
