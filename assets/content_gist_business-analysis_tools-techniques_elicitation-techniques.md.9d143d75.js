These techniques are critical in business analysis for identifying stakeholder needs, resolving issues, and determining solution options. Various elicitation techniques such as interviews, focus groups, facilitated workshops, and surveys can be employed depending on the context and objectives. The choice of technique may vary based on factors like the type of information needed, the complexity of the project, and stakeholder availability. <mark>Elicitation is often an iterative process and may involve the use of multiple techniques</mark> to gain a comprehensive understanding.</p><h2 id="common-elicitation-techniques" tabindex="-1">Common Elicitation Techniques <a class="header-anchor" href="#common-elicitation-techniques" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Common Elicitation Techniques&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><h3 id="brainstorming" tabindex="-1">Brainstorming <a class="header-anchor" href="#brainstorming" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Brainstorming&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Brainstorming is an elicitation technique used to quickly generate a broad range of ideas and options. It encourages free thinking and the sharing of ideas within a group setting, often led by a facilitator. Brainstorming can be particularly effective during Future State Analysis to identify potential capabilities or solutions for addressing a given business situation. It is also commonly used <mark>in conjunction with other techniques like affinity diagrams</mark> for categorizing and prioritizing the ideas generated. The primary objective is to produce an exhaustive list of options or insights within a short period of time, thus providing a foundation for further analysis and discussion. This technique can be particularly useful for breaking through creative blocks and encouraging innovative thinking.</p></li><li><h3 id="collaborative-games" tabindex="-1">Collaborative Games <a class="header-anchor" href="#collaborative-games" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Collaborative Games&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Collaborative games are interactive activities designed to engage stakeholders in the elicitation and exploration of requirements, opportunities, or challenges within a project. These games foster creativity, encourage participation, and facilitate dialogue among team members and stakeholders. Here are brief descriptions of some specific collaborative games:</p><ul><li><h4 id="product-box" tabindex="-1">Product Box <a class="header-anchor" href="#product-box" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Product Box&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Product Box game is an elicitation technique centered around understanding customer preferences for product features. Teams are given art supplies and a plain box, which they decorate to represent how they believe the product should be packaged. This exercise illuminates what features and benefits are most valuable to customers, as the box&#39;s limited size forces participants to prioritize certain elements like color, design, and slogans.</p></li><li><h4 id="speedboat" tabindex="-1">Speedboat <a class="header-anchor" href="#speedboat" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Speedboat&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Speedboat is another elicitation technique that focuses on identifying challenges or problematic features within a product. Participants are presented with a drawing of a boat anchored by several issues that slow it down. The issues are described and placed on individual anchors, and the team discusses the impact of each. This method offers a nonconfrontational way to talk about product deficiencies and encourages a team-based approach to solving them.</p></li><li><h4 id="spider-web" tabindex="-1">Spider Web <a class="header-anchor" href="#spider-web" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Spider Web&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Spider Web is an elicitation technique aimed at uncovering hidden relationships between the product in focus and other related products. A circle representing the product is drawn at the center of a large paper, and participants brainstorm other products that could be related. Connections are then drawn to indicate these relationships, and participants discuss the nature and significance of each. The result is a complex web that reveals potentially overlooked but important relationships, which can influence the scope and competitive positioning of the product.</p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id="document-analysis" tabindex="-1">Document Analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#document-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Document Analysis&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Document Analysis is an elicitation technique used to obtain relevant information by reviewing existing documentation. This could include policy documents, contracts, training materials, process maps, standard operating procedures, or any other documentation related to the business domain under investigation. The objective is to glean insights into the current state or requirements by systematically examining these documents. Document analysis is often used in tandem with other elicitation methods such as interviews or observation to provide a comprehensive view of the situation. This technique is particularly useful when stakeholders are unavailable for direct interaction, or when the documentation can provide historical context or data points that stakeholders may not readily have.</p></li><li><h3 id="facilitated-workshops" tabindex="-1">Facilitated Workshops <a class="header-anchor" href="#facilitated-workshops" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Facilitated Workshops&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Facilitated Workshops are structured meetings led by a skilled, neutral facilitator involving carefully selected stakeholders. These workshops aim to achieve specific objectives, such as defining requirements, solving problems, or making decisions. Facilitated workshops support interactivity, collaboration, and improved communications among participants, making them highly effective for complex scenarios where various stakeholder inputs are essential.</p></li><li><h3 id="focus-groups" tabindex="-1">Focus Groups <a class="header-anchor" href="#focus-groups" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Focus Groups&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Focus Groups are facilitated sessions with a group of stakeholders to gain insights into their attitudes, perceptions, and thoughts on a specific subject or range of topics. Typically, a focus group will have a mix of participants who have something in common (e.g., end-users, managers) and can offer valuable insights into customer needs or market trends. The primary benefit is to elicit qualitative data in a social setting where participants can react to each other&#39;s viewpoints.</p></li><li><h3 id="interviews" tabindex="-1">Interviews <a class="header-anchor" href="#interviews" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Interviews&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Interviews are one-on-one or small group sessions aimed at eliciting detailed and specific information. These can be formal or informal and can be structured with predefined questions or be more open-ended to allow for the capture of qualitative data. Interviews are particularly useful for gathering expert opinions, clarifying complex topics, or probing for unstated needs or requirements.</p></li><li><h3 id="observation" tabindex="-1">Observation <a class="header-anchor" href="#observation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Observation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Observation involves the direct watching of individuals or processes in their natural setting. Through observation, information about how a process is performed or a product is used can be elicited. This method is valuable for understanding the current state firsthand and for validating data gathered through other elicitation techniques.</p></li><li><h3 id="prototyping" tabindex="-1">Prototyping <a class="header-anchor" href="#prototyping" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Prototyping&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Prototyping is an elicitation and validation technique that involves creating a model of a proposed solution to explore its feasibility and to better understand stakeholder requirements. Prototypes can be either low-fidelity, such as wireframes or storyboards, or high-fidelity, such as a fully interactive digital interface. The purpose is to visualize how the end product will function and to allow stakeholders to interact with the model. This enables the business analyst and stakeholders to identify gaps, make corrections, and refine requirements in iterative cycles. Prototyping is particularly useful in situations where requirements are not well-understood or are difficult to articulate. The method can substantially reduce product-related risks by clarifying stakeholder expectations before full-scale development begins. Subtypes of prototyping include Evolutionary Prototyping, Storyboarding, and Wireframes.</p><ul><li><h4 id="evolutionary-prototyping" tabindex="-1">Evolutionary Prototyping <a class="header-anchor" href="#evolutionary-prototyping" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Evolutionary Prototyping&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Evolutionary Prototyping is an approach where a prototype of the solution evolves over time through iterative cycles of development, review, and refinement. With each iteration, the prototype becomes increasingly sophisticated and closer to the final product. This approach allows stakeholders to provide real-time feedback, enabling adjustments to be made more fluidly and reducing the risk of delivering a solution that doesn&#39;t meet the users&#39; needs.</p></li><li><h4 id="storyboarding" tabindex="-1">Storyboarding <a class="header-anchor" href="#storyboarding" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Storyboarding&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Storyboarding is a technique often used in the design and description of user experiences. It involves creating a visual narrative, similar to a comic strip, to display how a user will interact with the system or product. Storyboards provide an easy-to-understand method of showing the flow of interaction and can be particularly useful for explaining complex scenarios without requiring detailed technical explanations.</p></li><li><h4 id="wireframes" tabindex="-1">Wireframes <a class="header-anchor" href="#wireframes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Wireframes&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Wireframes are low-fidelity, simplified outlines of your product&#39;s layout, often used in website and application design. These are devoid of color, font choices, logos, or any real design elements that take away from purely focusing on a site’s structure. Wireframes allow stakeholders to understand how the user will interact with the interface, without being distracted by visual design elements. This helps in clarifying requirements and expectations early in the development process.</p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id="questionnaires-and-surveys" tabindex="-1">Questionnaires and Surveys <a class="header-anchor" href="#questionnaires-and-surveys" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Questionnaires and Surveys&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Questionnaires and Surveys are elicitation techniques that consist of a structured set of questions designed to collect information from stakeholders. These tools are particularly effective for gathering data from a large number of participants in a relatively short period of time. Questionnaires and surveys can be distributed in various formats, including paper, online forms, or via email. The questions can be open-ended, allowing for qualitative responses, or closed-ended, facilitating quantitative analysis. This technique is useful for understanding stakeholder opinions, preferences, or attitudes towards a particular issue or proposed solution. Confidentiality can be assured to encourage honest and candid responses, making it an effective tool for capturing information stakeholders might not be willing to share in a more public setting, such as interviews or focus groups.</p></li></ul>',4),s=[n];function r(l,c,d,h,u,p){return i(),t("div",null,s)}const g=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
