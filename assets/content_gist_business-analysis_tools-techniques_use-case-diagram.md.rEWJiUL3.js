These diagrams serve as a pivotal scope model in the landscape of business analysis. Below, we will thoroughly explore the various facets of Use Case Diagrams, including their construction, components, and utility across various stages of a portfolio, program, or project.</p><h2 id="constituent-elements" tabindex="-1">Constituent Elements <a class="header-anchor" href="#constituent-elements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Constituent Elements&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="ovals-and-use-cases" tabindex="-1">Ovals and Use Cases <a class="header-anchor" href="#ovals-and-use-cases" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ovals and Use Cases&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In a Use Case Diagram, each use case is symbolized by an oval, inside which the name of the use case is inscribed. These ovals are pivotal in outlining the functionality that is in scope for the solution.</p><h3 id="actors" tabindex="-1">Actors <a class="header-anchor" href="#actors" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Actors&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Actors are represented as stick figures in the diagram. These actors can be individuals, roles, or other systems that interact with the use cases.</p><h3 id="straight-lines-and-associations" tabindex="-1">Straight Lines and Associations <a class="header-anchor" href="#straight-lines-and-associations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Straight Lines and Associations&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Straight lines, also known as associations, connect actors to the use cases they interact with. Importantly, these associations are not indicative of the flow of information; rather, they merely denote that a particular actor is associated with a specific use case.</p><h2 id="timing-and-lifecycle" tabindex="-1">Timing and Lifecycle <a class="header-anchor" href="#timing-and-lifecycle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Timing and Lifecycle&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Creation of Use Case Diagrams usually occurs early within the lifecycle of a portfolio, program, or project. However, as project needs change or evolve, these diagrams are subject to updates, especially when use cases are modified, added, or removed based on prioritization and scope adjustments.</p><h2 id="example" tabindex="-1">Example <a class="header-anchor" href="#example" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example&quot;">​</a></h2>',12),h=t('<h2 id="utility-and-applications" tabindex="-1">Utility and Applications <a class="header-anchor" href="#utility-and-applications" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Utility and Applications&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="summarizing-scope" tabindex="-1">Summarizing Scope <a class="header-anchor" href="#summarizing-scope" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summarizing Scope&quot;">​</a></h3><p>One of the primary usages of Use Case Diagrams is to summarize the scope of a solution. This enables stakeholders to quickly discern the key features or use cases that are in scope and will be implemented.</p><h3 id="stakeholder-interaction" tabindex="-1">Stakeholder Interaction <a class="header-anchor" href="#stakeholder-interaction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stakeholder Interaction&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The diagram illustrates which stakeholders (represented as actors) will directly interact with the system, thereby making it a valuable tool for managing stakeholder expectations.</p><h3 id="interface-planning" tabindex="-1">Interface Planning <a class="header-anchor" href="#interface-planning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Interface Planning&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Use Case Diagrams offer insights into the interfaces that must be developed between the system and the actors. By visualizing these interfaces, the diagram aids in comprehensive planning and design.</p><h3 id="out-of-scope-indicators" tabindex="-1">Out-of-Scope Indicators <a class="header-anchor" href="#out-of-scope-indicators" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Out-of-Scope Indicators&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The diagram can also serve to indicate use cases that are considered out of scope. This is particularly useful for setting boundaries and managing stakeholder expectations.</p><h2 id="relationship-to-requirements" tabindex="-1">Relationship to Requirements <a class="header-anchor" href="#relationship-to-requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relationship to Requirements&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Although Use Case Diagrams are not a direct representation of requirements, they play a significant role in organizing requirements. They facilitate the planning and tracking of project progress and serve as an organizing framework for business analysis efforts or for structuring a requirements document.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Conclusion&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In summary, Use Case Diagrams are instrumental in providing a visual synopsis of the scope of a solution. They contribute to a broad array of project objectives including stakeholder management, interface planning, and requirements organization. Given their versatile applications and vital role in shaping and communicating the scope of a project, Use Case Diagrams are an indispensable tool in the business analysis toolbox.</p><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1">Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2>',14);function d(u,p,m,g,f,y){const s=e("MermaidJS"),i=e("QuizJS");return o(),r("div",null,[l,a(s,{id:"mermaid_owsw4kj42",text:"graph%20TD%0A%20%20%20%20subgraph%20%22Use%20Case%20Diagram%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20A1%5BActor1%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20A2%5BActor2%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20U1%5BUseCase1%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20U2%5BUseCase2%5D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20A1--%20Association%20--%3EU1%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20A1--%20Association%20--%3EU2%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20A2--%20Association%20--%3EU2%0A%20%20%20%20end"}),h,a(i,{quizData:[{id:4931,question:"What is the primary purpose of Use Case Diagrams in business analysis?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"To provide a detailed financial budget for the project."},{key:"B",text:"To graphically depict the scope of use cases within a solution, illustrating the functionality and actor interactions."},{key:"C",text:"They are used solely for documenting the technical architecture of a system."},{key:"D",text:"To record the personal data of project stakeholders."}],answer:"B",explanation:"Use Case Diagrams are used in business analysis primarily to graphically depict the scope of use cases within a solution.
