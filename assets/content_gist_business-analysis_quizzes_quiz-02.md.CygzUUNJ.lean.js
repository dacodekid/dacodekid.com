This approach aligns with the progressive elaboration of requirements, facilitating incremental requirement development. Initiating traceability after all requirements are detailed would be too delayed, contradicting the concept of rolling wave planning in requirement development. While establishing a formal traceability matrix, it's unnecessary to wait until a requirement is fully detailed from start to end, as traceability matrices are typically built in a hierarchical manner, starting with high-level requirements and adding details progressively. As lower-level requirements emerge, they should be assessed for alignment with higher-level ones. Although defining the traceability format is crucial, traceability can commence with the detailing of the first requirement."},{question:"When is business analysis traceability considered complete?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Upon mutual agreement with business stakeholders, usually during planning"},{key:"B",text:"When every requirement is fully articulated and detailed"},{key:"C",text:"As soon as all requirements are included in the requirement traceability matrix"},{key:"D",text:"After at least one requirement is articulated and detailed in the traceability matrix"}],answer:{key:"A",text:"Upon mutual agreement with business stakeholders, usually during planning"},explanation:"Business analysis traceability completion varies across organizations and is typically decided during planning in collaboration with business stakeholders.

While project managers handle project scope, business analysts focus on product scope. The traceability process of requirements exemplifies this involvement. As requirements are approved, corresponding work products across various phases are created, ensuring that no gaps exist between what is approved and what is built or tested. The Requirement Traceability Matrix assists in monitoring these relationships and is thus pivotal in understanding the breadth of a business analyst's involvement in tracking approved requirements and their associated work products."},{question:"In a situation where David, a business analyst, notices that certain design documents are missing in relation to approved requirements, and the business value of these requirements has diminished during development, what should his next step be?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Dismiss the approved requirements due to their low current business value"},{key:"B",text:"Instruct the team to immediately create the missing work products"},{key:"C",text:"Decide whether to cancel the approved requirements or create the missing work products later, based on current business value"},{key:"D",text:"Escalate the issue to the project sponsor"}],answer:{key:"C",text:"Decide whether to cancel the approved requirements or create the missing work products later, based on current business value"},explanation:"When discrepancies between approved requirements and the developed work products are discovered, a business analyst should evaluate whether to cancel or defer the requirements, or create the missing work products. This decision should be informed by the current business value of these requirements. If canceling them adds more value to the overall business objectives, the analyst should proceed accordingly, as outlined in the business analysis planning, which specifies the authority for requirement cancellation. In some cases, creating work products for low-value requirements might still be necessary due to other dependencies, necessitating a re-prioritization and scheduling of these tasks."},{question:"Which strategy is effective in preventing scope creep?",options:[{key:"A",text:"Ensure every work product is listed as a requirement attribute in the requirement traceability matrix"},{key:"B",text:"Guarantee each work product is linked back to an approved requirement"},{key:"C",text:"Involve stakeholders in maintaining the requirement traceability matrix"},{key:"D",text:"Utilize requirement traceability during impact analysis for change requests"}],answer:{key:"B",text:"Guarantee each work product is linked back to an approved requirement"},explanation:"To prevent scope creep, which is the uncontrolled expansion of project or product scope without corresponding adjustments in resources, time, and costs, it's crucial to continuously verify that each work product is directly linked to an approved requirement. This linkage ensures that all work aligns with the defined scope. Including every work product as a requirement attribute in the requirement traceability matrix can lead to excessive tracking and isn't a practical approach. While stakeholder involvement in maintaining the traceability matrix is beneficial, it's primarily the responsibility of the business analyst.
