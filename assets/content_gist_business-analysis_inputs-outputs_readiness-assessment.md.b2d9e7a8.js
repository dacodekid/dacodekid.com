The assessment not only identifies these risks but also proposes risk responses to address them, thereby helping to plan for a more effective transition.</p><p>In summary, a Readiness Assessment is a comprehensive evaluative measure that serves multiple functions—from identifying readiness gaps and associated risks to proposing risk responses and informing release decisions. The assessment can be tailored to suit the unique needs of the organization while also incorporating generic industry standards, making it a versatile tool in the Business Analyst&#39;s toolkit.</p>',16),o=[i];function r(d,l,p,c,h,u){return s(),n("div",null,o)}const g=e(a,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
