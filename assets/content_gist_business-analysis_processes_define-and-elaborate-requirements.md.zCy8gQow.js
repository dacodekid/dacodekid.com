The aim is to provide the necessary detail, format, and formality for diverse stakeholders. There are two main advantages of this process:</p><ol><li><p>Clarifying the product details so that teams can effectively utilize the information.</p></li><li><p>Storing the product details in a way that ensures stakeholders can easily access and utilize them.</p></li></ol><p>The process is complex and multifaceted, and business analysts are primarily recognized for performing it. The steps involve:</p><ul><li>Analyzing information from elicitation.</li><li>Using model analysis.</li><li>Undertaking relationship and dependency analysis.</li></ul><p>From this, requirements are identified and documented. Depending on where it&#39;s applied – portfolios, programs, or projects – the depth and detail might differ. For instance, there&#39;s usually more detail in programs and projects than in portfolios. If an adaptive approach is employed, this process can be used to elaborate user stories for any requirement types. Moreover, the process aids in defining attributes of the requirements.</p><p>This process also produces supporting product details like assumptions, constraints, dependencies, related issues, and product risks.</p><p>Iterative execution is a feature of this process. When any type of requirement is specified, it can reveal other relationships, dependencies, or gaps that call for more elicitation or model analysis. This process can occur simultaneously with others like Verify Requirements, Validate Requirements, Prioritize Requirements and Other Product Information, and Identify and Analyze Product Risks. Additionally, when defining user stories or requirements, it might be suitable to outline acceptance criteria, hence the Define Acceptance Criteria process might be executed alongside this.</p><p>Ultimately, through repeated iterations of the Define and Elaborate Requirements process, a reasonably comprehensive set of requirements is formed for the project life cycle. This could lead to well-defined user stories or thoroughly detailed functional requirements.</p><p>This activity encompasses defining all sorts of product data, and not just the requirements. Some of these include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Assumptions</strong>: These are factors related to various aspects of the business or solution that are taken as given without evidence. It&#39;s essential to track them because they can turn out to be false, altering the course of events. If an assumption is proven true, it&#39;s no longer an assumption and can be removed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraints</strong>: These are factors that impact the functioning of portfolios, programs, projects, or processes. In business analysis, they affect the creation or application of a solution. One example is business rules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dependencies</strong>: These are contingent factors upon which requirements depend. They provide support or control the requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Issues</strong>: These are subjects or discussions related to requirements or other product data. It&#39;s crucial to document these and monitor them until they are resolved to ensure complete requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Product risks</strong>: These are potential events or conditions that might positively or negatively impact the product. Risk analysis can sometimes be carried out alongside this process.</p></li></ul><p>Collectively, all these product details make up what&#39;s termed a &#39;requirements package.&#39; This package isn&#39;t necessarily a formal document. It could be evolving user stories in a backlog or details in a requirements management tool. The requirements package&#39;s formality and detail are guided by the project life cycle and stakeholder needs, both of which are established during planning activities.</p><h2 id="inputs" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="analysis-approach" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/analysis-approach.html">Analysis Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#analysis-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Analysis Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/analysis-approach.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The Analysis Approach provides a detailed framework or method to understand, evaluate, and interpret the confirmed elicitation results.
