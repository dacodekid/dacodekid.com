They act as a critical tool in the Business Analysis body of knowledge for representing interface-related requirements and acceptance criteria. System Interface Tables offer a structure to systematically document the exchange of data and rules between interfacing systems in a solution ecosystem.</p><h2 id="context-and-timing" tabindex="-1">Context and Timing <a class="header-anchor" href="#context-and-timing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Context and Timing&quot;">​</a></h2><p>System Interface Tables typically come into the picture after the ecosystem map and context diagram have been developed. These earlier artifacts identify what systems will interface with the solution system, thus setting the stage for the development of System Interface Tables.</p><h2 id="structure-and-components" tabindex="-1">Structure and Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure-and-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Structure and Components&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The table is usually arranged in a tabular format that includes specific attributes to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the interface. These attributes may include:</p><h3 id="source-system" tabindex="-1">Source System <a class="header-anchor" href="#source-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Source System&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Identifies the system from which the data originates.</p><h3 id="target-system" tabindex="-1">Target System <a class="header-anchor" href="#target-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Target System&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Specifies the system which is the end recipient of the data.</p><h3 id="data-fields" tabindex="-1">Data Fields <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-fields" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data Fields&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Details on the type of data that will be transferred from the source to the target system.</p><h3 id="volume-of-data-passed" tabindex="-1">Volume of Data Passed <a class="header-anchor" href="#volume-of-data-passed" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Volume of Data Passed&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Specifies the quantity and rate at which data will be transferred between systems.</p><h3 id="frequency" tabindex="-1">Frequency <a class="header-anchor" href="#frequency" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Frequency&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Indicates how often the data transfer occurs, whether it&#39;s real-time, batch processing, daily, etc.</p><h3 id="security-or-other-rules" tabindex="-1">Security or Other Rules <a class="header-anchor" href="#security-or-other-rules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Security or Other Rules&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Defines any security measures or rules that need to be in place for the data transfer to occur securely.</p><h3 id="validation-rules" tabindex="-1">Validation Rules <a class="header-anchor" href="#validation-rules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Validation Rules&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Outlines the requirements needed to ensure the data are passed and stored accurately and effectively.</p><h2 id="usage-and-application" tabindex="-1">Usage and Application <a class="header-anchor" href="#usage-and-application" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Usage and Application&quot;">​</a></h2><p>System Interface Tables serve the primary function of specifying the details for each interface within a solution&#39;s ecosystem. They are typically comprehensive enough to represent actual interface requirements, negating the need for additional requirements documentation related to the interface.</p><h2 id="relationship-to-requirements" tabindex="-1">Relationship to Requirements <a class="header-anchor" href="#relationship-to-requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relationship to Requirements&quot;">​</a></h2><p>While it&#39;s generally thought that requirements need to be written out in a detailed fashion, System Interface Tables are unique in that they themselves are detailed enough to represent the actual interface requirements. They are effectively stand-alone artifacts that cover every critical aspect of an interface, thus eliminating the necessity for parallel or supplementary requirements documents.</p><h2 id="example-scenario" tabindex="-1">Example Scenario <a class="header-anchor" href="#example-scenario" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example Scenario&quot;">​</a></h2><p>An example provided in the Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide involves a System Interface Table between a grocery store and a customer&#39;s mobile device. In this scenario, the table would specify the nature, frequency, and rules for transferring data like store information and recipes from the grocery store&#39;s system to the customer&#39;s mobile device.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Conclusion&quot;">​</a></h2><p>System Interface Tables are an invaluable asset in business analysis for detailing system interface requirements. By capturing a wealth of information ranging from the data fields to validation rules, they serve as a comprehensive model to ensure that all interface-related requirements are adequately addressed. This ensures that crucial details about the interface, such as the volume of data passed and security protocols, are not overlooked.</p><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1">Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2>',29);function c(d,u,h,m,f,y){const e=a("QuizJS");return s(),r("div",null,[l,n(e,{quizData:[{id:4901,question:"What is the primary function of a System Interface Table in business analysis?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"To serve as a financial ledger for the project."},{key:"B",text:"To detail the requirements for a single system interface, including data exchange and rules between interfacing systems."},{key:"C",text:"It is used solely for scheduling project timelines."},{key:"D",text:"To record the personal information of project team members."}],answer:"B",explanation:"The primary function of a System Interface Table in business analysis is to capture detailed-level requirements for a single system interface.
