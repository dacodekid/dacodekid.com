It consists of a series of images, sketches, or illustrations that represent the sequence of actions or steps a user will take to complete a specific task or achieve a certain objective.</p><h3 id="objectives-and-usage" tabindex="-1">Objectives and Usage <a class="header-anchor" href="#objectives-and-usage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objectives and Usage&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Visual Representation</strong>: The primary aim of storyboarding is to create a visual guide that represents the workflow or user path through a given system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interaction Flow</strong>: By illustrating the user&#39;s journey, storyboarding helps in understanding, discussing, and planning system functionality and navigation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Communication</strong>: It serves as a communication tool among team members and other stakeholders, making it easier to understand and discuss the system&#39;s design aspects.</p></li></ul><h3 id="characteristics" tabindex="-1">Characteristics <a class="header-anchor" href="#characteristics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Characteristics&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Sequential</strong>: Storyboards are inherently sequential, illustrating a step-by-step narrative of user interactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Annotations</strong>: Each frame or sketch is often accompanied by annotations to describe what&#39;s happening, what the user is thinking, or what the system is doing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low-Fidelity</strong>: Typically, storyboards are low-fidelity prototypes that don’t delve into the minute details but focus on higher-level interactions and flow.</p></li></ul><h3 id="applications" tabindex="-1">Applications <a class="header-anchor" href="#applications" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Applications&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>User Experience Design</strong>: Utilized to visualize how a user interacts with a system, often critical in User-Centered Design (UCD) approaches.</p></li><li><p><strong>Requirement Elicitation</strong>: Can serve to elicit user requirements and preferences, particularly in terms of user interface and interaction design.</p></li><li><p><strong>Validation</strong>: Offers a means to validate design ideas or assumptions before moving into more detailed design or development.</p></li></ul><h3 id="relationship-to-requirements" tabindex="-1">Relationship to Requirements <a class="header-anchor" href="#relationship-to-requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relationship to Requirements&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Clarification</strong>: Helps to clarify and refine requirements by providing a tangible representation of system behavior and interactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gap Identification</strong>: By visually mapping out the system, storyboarding can help identify missing requirements or gaps in the current analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feedback Loop</strong>: Provides an easy-to-understand medium for collecting feedback from stakeholders, which is crucial for requirements validation and refinement.</p></li></ul><h3 id="limitations-and-risks" tabindex="-1">Limitations and Risks <a class="header-anchor" href="#limitations-and-risks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Limitations and Risks&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Limited Depth</strong>: Storyboards typically focus on the &quot;happy path&quot; and might not capture all possible scenarios or exceptions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambiguity</strong>: Due to its low-fidelity nature, some details may be left open to interpretation, potentially causing confusion.</p></li></ul><p>Storyboarding is a valuable tool for conceptualizing and communicating how a system will be navigated and interacted with. It is often employed in the early stages of development to aid in requirements elicitation, design brainstorming, and stakeholder communication. It is most effective when used in conjunction with other techniques and tools, like use cases or wireframes, to provide a comprehensive view of the system’s functional and interaction design.</p>',13),o=[n];function r(l,c,d,p,u,h){return t(),i("div",null,o)}const y=e(s,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
