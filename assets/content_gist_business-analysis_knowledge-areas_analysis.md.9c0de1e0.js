Being a cornerstone activity in portfolios, programs, or projects, it often demands a considerable amount of effort.</p><p>Analysis is not limited to examining, modeling, and documenting product information. It also ensures the information is accurate, meets standards, is traceable to objectives, identifies inherent risks, and can be converted into product design.</p><p>While analysis can be performed on any product information, there&#39;s a pronounced focus on information related to requirements. The nature of the product information and its format largely depends on the project&#39;s life cycle. Typically, analysis processes are iterative and often occur alongside elicitation processes.</p><hr><h2 id="determine-analysis-approach" tabindex="-1">Determine Analysis Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#determine-analysis-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Determine Analysis Approach&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The process of Determine Analysis Approach is centered around strategizing how business analysis will be executed. It encompasses decisions regarding which facets will be analyzed, the most effective models to be used, and the methodologies for verifying, validating, and prioritizing requirements and other related product information. The primary advantage of this process is facilitating a collective understanding of the scope and nature of the business analysis work required for the solution&#39;s development.</p><p>The analysis approach clarifies:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Relevant Product Information:</strong> This pertains to the specific kind of product data that will be taken into account during business analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Beneficial Models:</strong> A forethought regarding which models are most valuable to produce during the process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Requirements Attributes:</strong> These are specific characteristics or properties linked to requirements. They are explored in greater detail in &quot;Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide&quot;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Requirements Life Cycle:</strong> In a predictive delivery framework, the life cycle delineates the various stages a requirement undergoes, such as definition, elaboration, verification, validation, and prioritization. In adaptive delivery, these stages might be more implicit, with requirements often marked as not ready, ready, or done. Here, &#39;done&#39; aligns with the successful delivery and acceptance of the solution segment that meets the requirement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Requirements Architecture:</strong> The analysis approach makes use of the established requirements architecture. This architecture outlines the interrelations between requirements, models, and other product data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Appropriate Analysis Models:</strong> These are the most fitting models for the task, highlighting their traceability to each other.</p></li><li><p><strong>Analysis Activities and Tools:</strong> The approach also outlines the pertinent analysis activities, the foundational templates for documenting requirements, the tools to be employed, and any potential modifications to these elements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Documentation Norms:</strong> For entities with less stringent documentation needs, the approach could dictate whether informal notes or sketches from sessions are to be retained or if more structured documentation is warranted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Analysis Activities &amp; Techniques:</strong> This involves considerations about the potential utility of analysis activities and techniques, the timing of their application, the stakeholders to be involved, and the ideal format for any resulting artifacts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concurrent Elicitation:</strong> Effective analysis often runs parallel to elicitation. As analysis tends to raise significant queries about the situation, further elicitation becomes necessary. Irrespective of the project life cycle, the processes of elicitation and analysis are generally iterative and closely intertwined. Thus, determining the analysis approach is a recurring activity throughout the lifespan of a portfolio, program, or project.</p></li></ol><p>In essence, while it&#39;s not mandatory to finalize all techniques before initiating the analysis, forward planning ensures that business analysts are better equipped to deploy a range of techniques.

If an assumption is proven true, it&#39;s no longer an assumption and can be removed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraints</strong>: These are factors that impact the functioning of portfolios, programs, projects, or processes.

One example is business rules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dependencies</strong>: These are contingent factors upon which requirements depend. They provide support or control the requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Issues</strong>: These are subjects or discussions related to requirements or other product data.

Rather, it delves deeper into its construction methodology and its aesthetic attributes. When it comes to crafting a solution, there&#39;s a plethora of alternatives to pick from. The role of business analysis becomes pivotal here, as it assists in evaluating these myriad options. This involves discerning the gamut of design choices at one&#39;s disposal and meticulously analyzing how these designs metamorphose into a concrete solution. The analytical outcomes corresponding to each option furnishes crucial details that elucidate the advantages, disadvantages, associated risks, and the financial implications of that particular choice. Every design alternative is juxtaposed with its counterparts to deduce which among them is the most congruent with the overarching product goals, constraints, financial stipulations, and temporal boundaries. Non-feasible designs are promptly eliminated from the list of contenders.</p><h3 id="design-deliberations" tabindex="-1">Design Deliberations <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-deliberations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design Deliberations&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Initiating conversations around design is imperative prior to commencing the actual construction of a solution or even its components. This stands true irrespective of the magnitude of the solution fragment in question. Bypassing these vital deliberations could culminate in objectives being overlooked or in products that aren&#39;t user-friendly. Moreover, the development phase of the product might become prolonged if the teams are caught up in spontaneous design decision-making.</p><p>Product-centric teams aren&#39;t bound to defer their product design evaluations until the culmination of the requirements phase. This evaluative process can run parallelly as fragments of requirements crystallize into design. It&#39;s pivotal to rank these requirements hierarchically to ensure that the design resonates with the most pressing requirements. In scenarios where this procedure is executed in an iterative and incremental fashion, design paradigms might undergo alterations across iterations, triggering some modifications. In scenarios following adaptive life cycles, such modifications are factored in during the planning phase. On the contrary, in a predictive life cycle framework, the design undergoes changes post the completion of the requirements phase. As a consequence, these alterations exert a more pronounced impact, often escalating costs. Such ramifications are especially pronounced when they stem from insights garnered during the product&#39;s developmental trajectory.</p><h3 id="design-scope" tabindex="-1">Design Scope <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-scope" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design Scope&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Design ideologies and analyses aren&#39;t confined solely to projects. They also permeate portfolios and programs. While designs attain their pinnacle of intricacy at the project level, serving as the bedrock for the solution&#39;s complete or partial realization, portfolios and programs also undergo design analysis. However, at these levels, the granularity is attuned just enough to guarantee uniformity across diverse solution releases or components.</p><hr><h3 id="inputs-8" tabindex="-1">Inputs <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs-8" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="analysis-approach-6" tabindex="-1"><a href="/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.html">Analysis Approach</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#analysis-approach-6" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Analysis Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The Analysis Approach provides the framework and guidelines for conducting product risk analysis, ensuring consistency and alignment with business goals and project objectives.
