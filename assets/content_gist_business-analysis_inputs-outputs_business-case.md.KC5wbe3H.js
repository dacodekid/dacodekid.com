It is essentially an economic feasibility study that <mark>justifies the investment</mark> needed for the initiative by detailing the value and benefits it will bring to the organization. Here&#39;s a breakdown of its key elements and roles:</p><h2 id="economic-feasibility-and-benefits" tabindex="-1">Economic Feasibility and Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#economic-feasibility-and-benefits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Economic Feasibility and Benefits&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The primary purpose of a business case is to establish the economic feasibility of an initiative. It lays out the anticipated benefits in terms of value to the organization, thus making it easier to justify the required investment. These benefits are often quantified in monetary terms or other value metrics that align with the organization&#39;s strategic objectives.</p><h2 id="link-to-business-goals-and-objectives" tabindex="-1">Link to Business Goals and Objectives <a class="header-anchor" href="#link-to-business-goals-and-objectives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Link to Business Goals and Objectives&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The business case is the tether that connects business goals and objectives to the actual work that needs to be done—whether that work is part of a portfolio component, program, or project. In doing so, it aligns the work with the organization’s overarching strategy.</p><h2 id="input-to-charter" tabindex="-1">Input to Charter <a class="header-anchor" href="#input-to-charter" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Input to Charter&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Once the business case is approved, it serves as a key input when creating a charter to initiate a portfolio component, program, or project. The charter often contains an abbreviated version of the business case, including crucial information like business need and the cost-benefit analysis.</p><h2 id="needs-assessment" tabindex="-1">Needs Assessment <a class="header-anchor" href="#needs-assessment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Needs Assessment&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The process of assembling a business case is one of the final steps in the Needs Assessment phase. This assessment, along with the business case, provides the foundation for defining the objectives of the initiative. They together serve as critical inputs to the charter that will be developed to initiate the project, program, or portfolio component.</p><h2 id="context-for-transition-and-prioritization" tabindex="-1">Context for Transition and Prioritization <a class="header-anchor" href="#context-for-transition-and-prioritization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Context for Transition and Prioritization&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In addition to providing the basis for initiating an effort, the business case also sets the context for the transition phase of the project or program. It can be used as a foundational document for prioritizing transition activities, especially when there are multiple stakeholders or competing requirements.</p><h2 id="authoritative-source-for-expected-benefits" tabindex="-1">Authoritative Source for Expected Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#authoritative-source-for-expected-benefits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Authoritative Source for Expected Benefits&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The business case is considered the authoritative source for outlining the expected benefits of an initiative. These benefits are usually detailed in a way that allows them to be tracked and measured, providing a clear framework for evaluating the success of the initiative as it progresses.</p><h2 id="decision-making-and-investment-justification" tabindex="-1">Decision-Making and Investment Justification <a class="header-anchor" href="#decision-making-and-investment-justification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Decision-Making and Investment Justification&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The business case serves as a pivotal tool for decision-makers. By laying out the cost-benefit analysis and outlining the business need, the document enables stakeholders to make informed decisions about whether or not to proceed with the initiative.</p><p>In summary, the Business Case is a multi-faceted document that serves several critical functions, from justifying the investment and linking to organizational goals, to setting the stage for the project charter and providing a basis for ongoing decision-making and prioritization.</p><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1">Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2>',18);function h(l,d,u,f,p,b){const e=i("QuizJS");return s(),a("div",null,[c,n(e,{quizData:[{id:15,question:"What is the main purpose of the Business Case in the context of project or portfolio management?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"To detail the technical specifications of the project."},{key:"B",text:"To establish the economic feasibility and justify the investment in an initiative."},{key:"C",text:"To create a detailed project schedule with deadlines and milestones."},{key:"D",text:"To serve as a legal contract between the organization and external stakeholders."}],answer:"B",explanation:"The primary purpose of the Business Case is to establish the economic feasibility of an initiative and justify the investment required, by detailing the value and benefits it will bring to the organization.<br><br>"},{id:16,question:"How does the Business Case link to Business Goals and Objectives?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"It provides a detailed technical roadmap for the project."},{key:"B",text:"It connects business goals and objectives with the actual work in portfolio components, programs, or projects."},{key:"C",text:"It focuses exclusively on the marketing and sales strategies for the project."},{key:"D",text:"It serves as a comprehensive risk management document."}],answer:"B",explanation:"The Business Case acts as a tether that links business goals and objectives with the actual work involved in portfolio components, programs, or projects, aligning them with the organization’s overarching strategy.<br><br>"},{id:17,question:"In what way does the Business Case contribute to the creation of a Charter?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"It provides a detailed budget breakdown for the project."},{key:"B",text:"It serves as a key input, containing essential information like business need and cost-benefit analysis."},{key:"C",text:"It outlines the specific qualifications and skills required for team members."},{key:"D",text:"It details the technology stack to be used in the project."}],answer:"B",explanation:"Once approved, the Business Case serves as a crucial input for creating a Charter, often containing an abbreviated version of the business case, including key details such as the business need and cost-benefit analysis.<br><br>"},{id:18,question:"What role does the Business Case play in the Needs Assessment phase?<br>",choices:[{key:"A",text:"It is mainly used for team building and human resource planning."},{key:"B",text:"It is one of the final steps, providing a foundation for defining the objectives of the initiative."},{key:"C",text:"It focuses on the development of the project's IT infrastructure."},{key:"D",text:"It serves as a document for external stakeholder communication."}],answer:"B",explanation:"In the Needs Assessment phase, assembling the Business Case is one of the final steps.
