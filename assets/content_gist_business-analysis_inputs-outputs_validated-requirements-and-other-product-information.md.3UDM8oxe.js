It is important to note that having validated requirements doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they are well-written or meet project standards. Here&#39;s an in-depth look into various facets:</p><h2 id="components" tabindex="-1">Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Components&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Requirements</strong>: These are conditions or capabilities needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other Product Information</strong>: This could include specifications, models, user stories, or any other documentation that gives context or additional details about the product.</p></li></ol><h2 id="verification-vs-validation" tabindex="-1">Verification vs Validation <a class="header-anchor" href="#verification-vs-validation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Verification vs Validation&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Verification</strong>: This is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Validation</strong>: This is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it fulfills the intended use. Validation ensures that &#39;you built the right thing,&#39; while verification ensures that &#39;you built it right.&#39;</p></li></ol><p>Although both verification and validation can happen in any sequence, they often occur in tandem. Once both processes are complete, the validated and verified requirements are then presented to stakeholders for further review and approval.</p><h2 id="stakeholder-agreement" tabindex="-1">Stakeholder Agreement <a class="header-anchor" href="#stakeholder-agreement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stakeholder Agreement&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The validation process involves stakeholder agreement, ensuring that the requirements and product information align with business goals and objectives. This consensus is critical for the success of the project as it assures that all parties have a shared understanding of what is to be delivered.</p><h2 id="inputs-for-other-processes" tabindex="-1">Inputs for Other Processes <a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs-for-other-processes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inputs for Other Processes&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Validated requirements and other product information serve as critical inputs for various other business analysis processes.
