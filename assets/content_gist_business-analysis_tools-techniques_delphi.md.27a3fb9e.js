This technique is particularly beneficial in the validation of requirements, among other applications such as prioritization and estimation.</p><h3 id="process-overview" tabindex="-1">Process Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#process-overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Process Overview&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Initiation</strong>: A facilitator initiates the process, usually by sending out a questionnaire to the SMEs. The questionnaire aims to elicit opinions, feedback, or insights about a particular subject—most commonly requirements validity in the context of business analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anonymity</strong>: One of the key features is the anonymous participation of experts, which serves to reduce bias and eliminates undue influence from any individual SME.</p></li><li><p><strong>Summary and Redistribution</strong>: After the first round of responses, the facilitator summarizes the collected data and redistributes it to the SMEs for another round of comments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iterative Rounds</strong>: This step is repeated in multiple rounds until the feedback starts to converge towards a consensus. The number of rounds may vary based on the complexity of the subject and the level of initial disagreement among the experts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consensus</strong>: The aim is to reach a consensus. If a consensus is achieved, the results are then documented and used as agreed upon, whether that be for validating requirements, prioritizing features, or any other decision-making process.</p></li></ol><h3 id="key-benefits" tabindex="-1">Key Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-benefits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Benefits&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Reduction of Bias</strong>: The anonymity and iterative nature of the process work to reduce individual biases and undue influence, which might otherwise skew the results.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Integrity</strong>: The iterative rounds and summarized feedback serve to refine and improve the quality of the collective wisdom, ultimately aimed at a more reliable consensus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Informed Decision-making</strong>: With input from multiple SMEs, decisions based on Delphi technique results are generally well-rounded and thoroughly considered.</p></li></ul><h3 id="key-applications" tabindex="-1">Key Applications <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-applications" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Applications&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Validate Requirements</strong>: In the requirements validation phase, SMEs can use the Delphi technique to collectively agree on the validity and sufficiency of the proposed requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Estimation and Prioritization</strong>: Delphi can also be employed for making more accurate estimations, and for prioritizing requirements, features, or user stories.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design Options</strong>: When multiple design solutions are possible, the Delphi technique can aid in choosing the most feasible or effective one.</p></li></ul><p>In conclusion, the Delphi technique is a robust method for achieving a high-quality consensus within a group of experts, particularly useful in scenarios where bias and influence can be detrimental to the decision-making process.</p>',9),o=[a];function r(l,c,h,u,d,p){return i(),t("div",null,o)}const g=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
