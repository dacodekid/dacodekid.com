The primary goal is <mark>to understand the user behavior and develop</mark> a shared understanding among all stakeholders.</p><h3 id="core-principles" tabindex="-1">Core Principles <a class="header-anchor" href="#core-principles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Core Principles&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Start with Behavior</strong>: BDD begins by understanding how the user will interact with the product, essentially focusing on the behavior rather than just the technical specifications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaboration and Conversation</strong>: BDD facilitates discussions between users or customers and those who are implementing the solution. These conversations often lead to real-life examples, enabling a shared understanding of what the product should do.</p></li><li><p><strong>Write Tests First</strong>: Following the principles of TDD, tests for the expected behavior are written first. This helps ensure that the solution is aligned with user expectations and is less prone to defects.</p></li></ol><h3 id="given-when-then" tabindex="-1">Given-When-Then <a class="header-anchor" href="#given-when-then" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Given-When-Then&quot;">​</a></h3><p>One of the cornerstone techniques within BDD is the use of the <mark>&quot;Given-When-Then&quot; syntax</mark> for crafting acceptance criteria for user stories. This structured format is aimed at providing a clear and shared understanding of the criteria that the solution must satisfy.</p><ul><li><strong>Given</strong>: Specifies the preconditions and initial state before an action takes place.</li><li><strong>When</strong>: Describes the action or trigger performed by the user.</li><li><strong>Then</strong>: Defines the expected outcomes or state change as a result of the action.</li></ul><p>For example, acceptance criteria could be: &quot;<strong>Given a user is logged in, when they click the logout button, then they should be logged out and redirected to the homepage.</strong>&quot;</p><h3 id="flexibility-in-acceptance-criteria" tabindex="-1">Flexibility in Acceptance Criteria <a class="header-anchor" href="#flexibility-in-acceptance-criteria" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Flexibility in Acceptance Criteria&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While the Given-When-Then format is widely used, BDD does not mandate this particular structure. Any format that clearly describes the preconditions, actions, and expected post-conditions can be employed, provided it ensures effective communication among stakeholders.</p><h3 id="lifecycle-applicability" tabindex="-1">Lifecycle Applicability <a class="header-anchor" href="#lifecycle-applicability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Lifecycle Applicability&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Though BDD is especially popular in adaptive (Agile) approaches, its principles and techniques can be applied across various life cycle methodologies. Its emphasis on stakeholder collaboration and alignment of development with user behavior makes it broadly applicable.</p><h3 id="benefits" tabindex="-1">Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefits&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Enhanced Collaboration</strong>: BDD encourages active participation from all stakeholders, including business and technical team members.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clearer Requirements</strong>: The Given-When-Then format helps in the clear articulation of acceptance criteria, minimizing ambiguities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quality Assurance</strong>: Writing tests before development ensures that the code is always testable, leading to better quality and fewer defects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shared Understanding</strong>: The approach fosters a shared understanding of user requirements and expected product behavior, reducing the scope of misunderstandings and scope creep.</p></li></ol><p>Behavior-Driven Development serves as an impactful technique in the Business Analyst’s toolkit, aiding in the alignment of development activities with user behavior and stakeholder expectations.</p>',15),o=[s];function r(l,c,h,d,p,u){return t(),i("div",null,o)}const v=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{g as __pageData,v as default};
