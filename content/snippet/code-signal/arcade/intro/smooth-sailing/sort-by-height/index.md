# Sort By Height

Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

## Example

For `a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180]`, the output should be

```:no-line-numbers
sort_by_height(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190]
```

## Solution

::: code-group
<<< ./sort-by-height.py [PYTHON]
<<< ./sort-by-height.js [JAVASCRIPT]
:::
