# Adjacent Elements Product

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

## Example

For `inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3]`, the output should be

```:no-line-numbers
adjacent_elements_product(inputArray) = 21
```

`7` and `3` produce the largest product.

## Solution

::: code-group
<<< ./adjacent-elements-product.py [PYTHON]
<<< ./adjacent-elements-product.js [JAVASCRIPT]
