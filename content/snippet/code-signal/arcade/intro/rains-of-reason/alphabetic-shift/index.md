# Alphabetic Shift

Given a string, your task is to replace each of its characters by the next one in the English alphabet; i.e. replace `a` with `b`, replace `b` with `c`, etc (`z` would be replaced by `a`).

## Example

For `inputString = "crazy"`, the output should be

```:no-line-numbers
alphabetic_shift(inputString) = "dsbaz"
```

## Solution

::: code-group
<<< ./alphabetic-shift.py [PYTHON]
<<< ./alphabetic-shift.js [JAVASCRIPT]
:::
