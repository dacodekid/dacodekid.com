# Avoid Obstacles

You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.

Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate `0` to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.

Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

## Example

For `inputArray = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9]`, the output should be

```:no-line-numbers
avoid_obstacles(inputArray) = 4
```
