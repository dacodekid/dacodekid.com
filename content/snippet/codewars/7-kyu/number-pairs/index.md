# Number Pairs

In this Kata the aim is to compare each pair of integers from 2 arrays, and return a new array of large numbers.

::: tip Note
Both arrays have the same dimensions.
:::

## Example

```:no-line-numbers
arr1 = [13, 64, 15, 17, 88]
arr2 = [23, 14, 53, 17, 80]

number_pairs(arr1, arr2) == [23, 64, 53, 17, 88]
```

## Solution

::: code-group
<<< ./number-pairs.py [PYTHON]
