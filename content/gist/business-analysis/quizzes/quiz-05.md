Question: You are managing a complex software development project for an external client using a waterfall approach, as per contract requirements. However, you believe a different approach might be more effective, considering that customer requirements often become clearer through ongoing interactions. What would be an effective strategy to mitigate risks associated with the waterfall approach?
A: Segment the project into multiple phases with phase gates.
B: Implement a hybrid life cycle.
C: Switch to an iterative life cycle.

A: Largest features providing no customer value
B: Largest features expected to deliver customer value
C: Smallest features expected to deliver customer value
D: Smallest features providing no customer value
Answer: C
Explanation: Minimum Marketable Features (MMF) refer to the smallest set of functionalities that still deliver value to the customer. This concept is used for prioritizing features that maximize value while being efficiently deliverable.

Question: When estimating in a project, which technique involves deriving estimates by comparing against a similar scope of work rather than using absolute cost or time metrics?
A: Bottom-up estimation
B: Parametric estimation
C: Relative estimation

A: Seek a consensus through discussions and agreements.
B: Dismiss the requirement that demands more development resources.
C: Approve the development of both requirements, considering them as optional features.
D: Discard the requirement that offers lesser business value.
Answer: A
Explanation: The responsibility of choosing which features to implement does not fall on the business analyst. It's the stakeholders and, in adaptive projects, the product owner who have the authority to accept or reject requirements. As a business analyst, your role involves resolving these conflicts by engaging in negotiations with the authorities responsible for approving these requirements.

B: Prioritize the "indifferent" category features for development.
C: Prioritize the "reverse category" features for development.
D: Prioritize the "delighters" category features for development.
Answer: A
Explanation: The Kano model categorizes features based on customer perspectives. Basic features, though not significantly enhancing satisfaction, cause dissatisfaction if absent. Delighters and indifferent features, in contrast, don't cause dissatisfaction when missing. Reverse category features are generally avoided.

Question: In adaptive lifecycle projects, instead of a scope baseline used in predictive projects, what is employed to analyze the project's scope performance?
A: WBS
B: WBS Dictionary
C: Backlogs
D: Scope Statement
Answer: C
