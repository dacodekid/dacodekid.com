A: Discretionary dependency
B: Value dependency
C: Implementation dependency
D: Subsets
Answer: D

Question: A team developing a new product has begun its initial iteration, incorporating chosen user stories for this phase. A high-ranking stakeholder has proposed a modification to a user story that is part of the current iteration. How should the team handle this suggested change?
A: Substitute the affected user story with the revised one in the iteration backlog.
B: Refer the issue to the product owner.
C: Dismiss any changes during the iteration, advising the requester to wait until the iteration concludes.
D: Incorporate the proposed change as an additional user story in the iteration backlog.

B: Delegates may not possess the authority to validate requirements on behalf of their seniors.
C: This redundant exercise poses a risk of exceeding the project budget.
D: The workshop may lead to the addition of new requirements to the backlog.
Answer: A

B: Elicitation and analysis may occur iteratively to refine information progressively.
C: Elicitation is a repetitive, cyclical process.
D: The volume of business analysis information can decrease upon analysis.
Answer: A
Explanation: Elicitation is more than just collecting or gathering product information. Often, stakeholders do not have the necessary product information readily available. It is the business analyst's task to find methods to elicit this information from stakeholders.

Question: You've recently joined a team tasked with developing an internal information management system and are in the planning phase, responsible for eliciting product requirements and creating a work breakdown structure.

Question: Your organization's Strategy and Planning department regularly analyzes the current state to update the organization's strategy, goals, and objectives, proposing transformation projects for the PMO and impacted departments or business units. Which statement could be true in this scenario?
A: Business analysts on each project bypass the Assess Current State process.
B: Each proposed transformation project needs initiation by the PMO.
C: This is a highly projectized organization with a minimal hierarchy.
D: No additional business analysis is needed for each initiated project.
Answer: A
Explanation: This scenario doesn't suggest a highly projectized organization due to the presence of multiple departments and business units. The PMO should evaluate all proposed initiatives for viability based on organizational capabilities and resources. Every project requires specific business analysis work. However, frequent current state assessments by the Strategy and Planning department may lead to business analysts on transformation projects skipping this step, relying on available knowledge.

A: Instruct the project team to complete the remaining scope.
B: Provide more funds to the project to overcome the diminishing returns.
C: Discontinue the project.
D: Add more staff to the project to speed up completion.
Answer: C
Explanation: At the point of diminishing returns, the additional benefit gained from a solution does not justify the extra effort required. In this scenario, Solution Evaluation allows for early termination of the project if further functionality does not add significant value, enabling the reallocation of resources to higher-priority projects.

Question: Your software development project is facing challenges due to numerous defects. Despite thorough planning and meticulous requirement gathering, these issues have arisen. You and your team plan to conduct a thorough analysis of these problems using a cause-and-effect diagram. Which statement is incorrect about this diagram?

A: Employ group decision-making techniques.
B: Establish meeting guidelines.
C: Escalate the issue to higher management.
D: Apply the feature injection method.
