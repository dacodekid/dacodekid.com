# Analysis

Analysis encompasses the comprehensive assessment and documentation of product data to ensure it aligns with stakeholder needs, their objectives, and helps in identifying feasible solution designs.

## Key Concepts

Analysis fundamentally involves a thorough examination, decomposition, synthesis, and elucidation of information to enhance, understand, and refine it. Being a cornerstone activity in portfolios, programs, or projects, it often demands a considerable amount of effort.

Analysis is not limited to examining, modeling, and documenting product information. It also ensures the information is accurate, meets standards, is traceable to objectives, identifies inherent risks, and can be converted into product design.

While analysis can be performed on any product information, there's a pronounced focus on information related to requirements. The nature of the product information and its format largely depends on the project's life cycle. Typically, analysis processes are iterative and often occur alongside elicitation processes.
