# Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder Engagement encompasses the various procedures involved in recognizing, analyzing, and effectively communicating and collaborating with individuals or entities that have an interest in the proposed solution. It aims at ensuring a mutual understanding of the business analysis activities necessary to delineate the solution, followed by regular evaluations to guarantee the efficacy of the business analysis process.

## Key Concepts

Stakeholder Engagement revolves around the tasks carried out to comprehend the requirements and characteristics of stakeholders, ensuring the most effective ways to recognize, engage, communicate, and collaborate with them. Though not exclusive to business analysis, when executed within this discipline, the goal is to guarantee optimal stakeholder engagement throughout the business analysis processes.

A significant portion of business analysis pertains to communication. The Stakeholder Engagement processes emphasize the individuals or groups linked, either directly or indirectly, to the situation being analyzed or to the solution. Clarity regarding who should be included in the business analysis process, combined with concerted efforts to collaborate and adopt practices that are supportive, yields immense benefits not just for business analysis, but also for portfolio, program, and project management. Stakeholder Engagement, in essence, ensures maximum representation and sustained interest and participation from the stakeholder community.
