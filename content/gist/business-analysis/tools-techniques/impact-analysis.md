# Impact Analysis

In the realm of Impact Analysis, a pivotal first step involves assessing the impact of a proposed change on the existing requirements baseline. The business analyst employs a traceability matrix to make this assessment. A traceability matrix is a tool that links requirements to their origins and traces them throughout the project life cycle. By leveraging this matrix, the analyst can quickly pinpoint which requirements are affected by the proposed change.

The assessment is not just a matter of listing impacted requirements; it also involves gauging the extent and nature of the impact. Is the proposed change a modification to an existing requirement, or does it introduce a new set of requirements? Alternatively, does the proposed change add further details to existing requirements? By answering these questions, the business analyst can quantify, at least roughly, the scale and complexity of the proposed change as it relates to the requirements baseline.

### Conflict Assessment

An essential part of Impact Analysis is to assess whether the proposed change conflicts with other existing or baselined requirements. The business analyst conducts this assessment against the backdrop of requirements that have been logged in the requirements backlog or those that have been formally baselined.

The goal is to identify "conflicting requirements," meaning requirements that, when implemented, would render another requirement unimplementable or would break existing solution components. When such conflicts are spotted, the business analyst acts as a facilitator to resolve the issue. This often involves scheduling requirement sessions with stakeholders to discuss alternatives and reach a consensus. The aim is to preserve the integrity of the requirements baseline and any solution components that have already been implemented.

### Impact on Business Analysis Activities

Impact Analysis is not just external; it also has an inward-facing component. Specifically, the business analyst must evaluate how the proposed change will affect ongoing business analysis activities. This includes business analysis work that has been completed and approved, as well as work that is still in progress.

Depending on how advanced the solution is in its development cycle, the business analyst collaborates with project team members accountable for product development to determine the impact. If the proposed change is high-priority, it may necessitate a reordering of business analysis activities. This becomes especially relevant in projects following an adaptive project life cycle, which is inherently more accommodating of changes.

Moreover, the business analyst has to consider the effect of the change on existing business analysis documents. These documents serve as inputs for other project team members, and thus must be kept up-to-date to reflect the most current requirements accurately.

### Impact on Project Management

Any change, no matter how trivial it appears, must be analyzed for its potential impact on the overall project management. An approved change can have a ripple effect on various subsidiary plans within the project management plan. These could include the Schedule Management Plan, Cost Management Plan, and Risk Management Plan, among others.

The business analyst collaborates with the project manager to assess these impacts properly. This cooperative effort ensures a comprehensive understanding of the proposed change's implications, capturing both project and product viewpoints.

### Recommending a Course of Action

The final stage in Impact Analysis involves assembling the collected data and formulating a recommendation. This often takes the form of a mini-business case, encompassing pros and cons, assumptions, risks, and other pertinent details. This recommendation is then submitted to the approving authority, which could be a Change Control Board (CCB) or another designated body.

Depending on the organizational processes or external regulations, the level of detail and formality required in this recommendation can vary. Once an action (approval, deferment, or rejection) is decided upon, the business analyst is responsible for communicating this outcome to all interested stakeholders. This communication is crucial for transparency and for setting expectations regarding the future course of the project.

Impact Analysis is a multifaceted technique that encompasses several crucial dimensions, from assessing the effect on the requirements baseline to evaluating conflicts, and from gauging the impact on business analysis activities to understanding project management implications. Through this comprehensive technique, the business analyst provides the insights needed for informed decision-making concerning proposed changes.
