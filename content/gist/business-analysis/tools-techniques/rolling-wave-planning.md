# Rolling Wave Planning

Rolling Wave Planning is an iterative approach to planning that allows for adjustments as a project unfolds or as more information becomes available. In the context of business analysis, this technique has applications in both predictive and adaptive life cycles.

## Predictive Life Cycle Context

In a predictive or traditional life cycle, business analysts may work closely with the project manager to develop rolling wave estimates for various business analysis tasks. These estimates would be aligned with the overall project schedule and would focus on detailed planning for near-term tasks while keeping planning for future tasks at a higher level. This allows for greater flexibility in accommodating changes or new information as the project progresses.

## Adaptive Life Cycle Context

In an adaptive life cycle, commonly seen in Agile frameworks, rolling wave planning is often employed at the release level. This technique aids in determining the features and functions that will be part of the current or upcoming release. Rather than trying to plan every detail from the start, the planning occurs in "waves" as the project progresses and as more information becomes available.

## Role of Progressive Elaboration

Progressive elaboration, or the gradual detailing of project plans, aligns closely with rolling wave planning. As the project advances, further analysis identifies specific features and epics for inclusion in the current release. New information is continuously incorporated into plans, allowing for a more flexible and adaptive planning process.

## Implications for Business Analysis

The business analyst plays a critical role in rolling wave planning. In a predictive life cycle, the business analyst may be responsible for creating or assisting in the creation of detailed plans for near-term business analysis tasks. In an adaptive life cycle, the business analyst could work closely with the product owner and the development team to determine which features, functions, or epics should be prioritized for the upcoming release based on the most current information.

By employing rolling wave planning, business analysts and project teams can adapt more easily to changes and new information, thereby reducing the risk associated with long-term planning while still maintaining a degree of structure and direction.

Question: What is the primary purpose of Rolling Wave Planning in project management?
A: To provide a detailed financial forecast for the entire project
B: To plan projects iteratively, allowing for adjustments as new information becomes available
C: To serve as a legal framework for project planning
D: To focus solely on the technical planning of a project
Answer: B
Explanation: The primary purpose of Rolling Wave Planning in project management is to plan projects iteratively, allowing for flexibility and adjustments as the project unfolds and as more information becomes available. This approach is particularly useful in both predictive and adaptive life cycles, enabling teams to adapt to changes and new insights while maintaining a structured planning process.

Question: How does Rolling Wave Planning function in a predictive life cycle?
A: By focusing on the financial aspects of the project
B: By enabling detailed planning for near-term tasks while keeping future tasks at a higher level
C: By serving as a legal guideline for project planning
D: By emphasizing the technical details in project planning
Answer: B
Explanation: In a predictive life cycle, Rolling Wave Planning functions by allowing business analysts and project managers to focus on detailed planning for near-term tasks while keeping the planning for future tasks at a higher level. This approach provides flexibility to accommodate changes or new information as the project progresses, aligning with the overall project schedule.

Question: What role does Progressive Elaboration play in Rolling Wave Planning?
A: It provides a detailed financial breakdown of the project.
B: It involves the gradual detailing of project plans as more information becomes available.
C: It focuses on the legal aspects of project planning.
D: It emphasizes the technical specifications in project planning.
Answer: B
Explanation: Progressive elaboration plays a crucial role in Rolling Wave Planning as it involves the gradual detailing of project plans based on new information and insights gained as the project progresses. This concept aligns closely with rolling wave planning, allowing for a more adaptive and flexible planning process.

Question: How is Rolling Wave Planning applied in an adaptive life cycle, such as Agile?
A: By providing a financial forecast for each release
B: By planning at the release level, determining features and functions for current or upcoming releases
C: By serving as a legal document for each release
D: By focusing solely on technical aspects for each release
Answer: B
Explanation: In an adaptive life cycle, like Agile, Rolling Wave Planning is applied at the release level. It aids in determining the features and functions that will be part of the current or upcoming release. Instead of planning every detail from the start, the planning occurs in "waves" as more information becomes available, aligning with the iterative nature of Agile frameworks.

Question: What is the role of the business analyst in Rolling Wave Planning?
A: To provide a financial analysis for each phase of the project
B: To assist in detailed planning for near-term tasks and prioritizing features or epics for upcoming releases
C: To focus on the legal compliance of project planning
D: To emphasize the technical development aspects in planning
Answer: B
Explanation: In Rolling Wave Planning, the business analyst plays a critical role. In a predictive life cycle, the analyst may be responsible for creating detailed plans for near-term business analysis tasks. In an adaptive life cycle, the analyst often works closely with the product owner and development team to prioritize features, functions, or epics for the upcoming release based on current information.
