# Root Cause and Opportunity Analysis

## [Fishbone/Ishikawa Diagram](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/fishbone-ishikawa-diagram.md)

This diagram, also known as a cause-and-effect diagram, visualizes potential causes of a specific problem or effect. It's structured in a way that categories of potential causes branch out from the main spine, resembling a fishbone.

## [Five-Whys](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/five-whys.md)

A root cause analysis method where you ask "why?" five times (or as many times as necessary) to trace back the chain of events leading to a problem. The goal is to identify the fundamental cause and prevent recurrence.

## [Interrelationship Diagrams](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/interrelationship-diagrams.md)

These diagrams display how different issues are related to one another. They help in understanding the causal relationships among a set of ideas or issues, providing a visual means to track back root causes.
