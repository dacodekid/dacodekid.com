# System Interface Table

System Interface Tables are intricate models specifically designed to capture detailed-level requirements for a single system interface. They act as a critical tool in the Business Analysis body of knowledge for representing interface-related requirements and acceptance criteria. System Interface Tables offer a structure to systematically document the exchange of data and rules between interfacing systems in a solution ecosystem.

## Context and Timing

System Interface Tables typically come into the picture after the ecosystem map and context diagram have been developed. These earlier artifacts identify what systems will interface with the solution system, thus setting the stage for the development of System Interface Tables.

## Structure and Components

The table is usually arranged in a tabular format that includes specific attributes to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the interface. These attributes may include:

### Source System

Identifies the system from which the data originates.

### Target System

Specifies the system which is the end recipient of the data.

### Data Fields

Details on the type of data that will be transferred from the source to the target system.

### Volume of Data Passed

Specifies the quantity and rate at which data will be transferred between systems.

### Frequency

Indicates how often the data transfer occurs, whether it's real-time, batch processing, daily, etc.

### Security or Other Rules

Defines any security measures or rules that need to be in place for the data transfer to occur securely.

### Validation Rules

Outlines the requirements needed to ensure the data are passed and stored accurately and effectively.

## Usage and Application

System Interface Tables serve the primary function of specifying the details for each interface within a solution's ecosystem. They are typically comprehensive enough to represent actual interface requirements, negating the need for additional requirements documentation related to the interface.

## Relationship to Requirements

While it's generally thought that requirements need to be written out in a detailed fashion, System Interface Tables are unique in that they themselves are detailed enough to represent the actual interface requirements. They are effectively stand-alone artifacts that cover every critical aspect of an interface, thus eliminating the necessity for parallel or supplementary requirements documents.

## Example Scenario

An example provided in the Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide involves a System Interface Table between a grocery store and a customer's mobile device. In this scenario, the table would specify the nature, frequency, and rules for transferring data like store information and recipes from the grocery store's system to the customer's mobile device.

## Conclusion

System Interface Tables are an invaluable asset in business analysis for detailing system interface requirements. By capturing a wealth of information ranging from the data fields to validation rules, they serve as a comprehensive model to ensure that all interface-related requirements are adequately addressed. This ensures that crucial details about the interface, such as the volume of data passed and security protocols, are not overlooked.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary function of a System Interface Table in business analysis?
A: To serve as a financial ledger for the project.
B: To detail the requirements for a single system interface, including data exchange and rules between interfacing systems.
C: It is used solely for scheduling project timelines.
D: To record the personal information of project team members.
Answer: B
Explanation: The primary function of a System Interface Table in business analysis is to capture detailed-level requirements for a single system interface. This includes documenting the exchange of data and the rules governing the interface between different systems within a solution ecosystem.

Question: How does the System Interface Table relate to the overall requirements documentation?
A: It is generally unrelated to the requirements documentation.
B: The table itself is detailed enough to represent actual interface requirements, often eliminating the need for additional requirements documentation.
C: System Interface Tables are only used for documenting non-functional requirements.
D: It is solely used for project scheduling, not for requirements.
Answer: B
Explanation: System Interface Tables are unique in that they are often comprehensive enough to represent the actual interface requirements themselves. This level of detail usually negates the need for additional, separate requirements documentation related to the interface.

Question: What type of information is typically included in the 'Data Fields' component of a System Interface Table?
A: General project goals and objectives.
B: Details about the type of data that will be transferred from the source system to the target system.
C: Only financial data related to the project.
D: Personal data of the project stakeholders.
Answer: B
Explanation: The 'Data Fields' component of a System Interface Table includes detailed information about the type of data that will be transferred from the source system to the target system, outlining the nature of the data exchange.

Question: In what scenario would a System Interface Table be particularly useful?
A: Only in financial planning for the project.
B: When detailing the requirements for data exchange between two systems in a solution's ecosystem, like a grocery store system interfacing with a customer's mobile device.
C: It is exclusively used in the final stages of project deployment.
D: System Interface Tables are primarily used for social media marketing strategies.
Answer: B
Explanation: A System Interface Table is particularly useful in scenarios where detailed requirements for data exchange between interfacing systems within a solution's ecosystem need to be captured. For example, it would be used to specify the nature, frequency, and rules of data transfer between a grocery store's system and a customer's mobile device.

Question: Why are System Interface Tables considered a critical tool in business analysis?
A: They are only critical for aesthetic purposes in project documentation.
B: They provide a structured and comprehensive model for documenting interface-related requirements, ensuring all critical aspects are covered.
C: These tables are mainly for legal documentation and have little practical use.
D: They are critical because they focus only on the project timeline.
Answer: B
Explanation: System Interface Tables are considered a critical tool in business analysis because they offer a structured and comprehensive model to document all the critical aspects of system interface requirements. This ensures that important details such as data types, frequency, and security measures are thoroughly addressed.
