# Payback Period (PBP)

The Payback Period is a simple financial metric used to determine the time it takes for an investment or project to "pay back" its initial cost. In other words, it represents the time it takes for the cumulative cash flows to equal the initial investment.

## **Formula**

Given an initial investment \( C_0 \) and cash inflows for each period \( CF_t \), the Payback Period (PP) is the time \( t \) such that:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{t} CF_i \geq C_0
$$

Where:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& CF_t = \text{Cash inflow during the period } t \\
& C_0 = \text{Initial investment} \\
& t = \text{Time period}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Interpretation**

- A shorter Payback Period is generally preferred as it indicates quicker recovery of the initial investment.
- It helps in assessing the liquidity risk associated with an investment.

## **Strengths**

- Simple and easy to understand.
- Useful for projects where liquidity is a concern or when dealing with high-risk investments.

## **Limitations**

- Does not account for the time value of money.
- Ignores cash flows that occur after the Payback Period, hence may not consider the overall profitability of the project.

## **Example**

If a project requires an initial investment of $100,000 and is expected to generate cash inflows of $50,000 each year, then the Payback Period is:

$$
\text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{\$100,000}}{\text{\$50,000/year}} = 2 \text{ years}
$$

This means the project will take 2 years to recover the initial investment of $100,000.

## Quiz

Question: Why is a shorter Payback Period generally preferred in project evaluation?
A: It indicates a longer duration for the project to be profitable and viable.
B: A shorter Payback Period suggests quicker recovery of the initial investment, reducing the liquidity risk.
C: Shorter Payback Periods are preferred as they indicate higher long-term profitability of the project.
D: It implies that the project will have a longer lifespan and generate more cash flows.
Answer: B
Explanation: A shorter Payback Period is preferred as it indicates a quicker recovery of the initial investment, which is beneficial particularly in terms of reducing liquidity risk associated with the investment.

Question: What is a major limitation of the Payback Period as a financial metric?
A: It provides detailed information about the profitability after the payback is achieved but not before.
B: The Payback Period always accounts for the time value of money in its calculation.
C: It omits cash flows after the Payback Period, potentially missing overall project profitability.
D: It is a complex and difficult metric to calculate.
Answer: C
Explanation: A key limitation of the Payback Period is that it does not consider cash flows beyond the payback point. This can result in a lack of insight into the overall profitability of the project, as future cash flows are ignored.

Question: How does the Payback Period metric contribute to assessing liquidity risk?
A: By focusing on long-term profitability rather than initial investment recovery time.
B: It gauges liquidity risk by assessing how quickly the initial investment can be recouped.
C: The Payback Period is not related to liquidity risk assessment at all.
D: By calculating the total profit at the end of the project life.
Answer: B
Explanation: The Payback Period helps in assessing liquidity risk by indicating the duration needed to recover the initial investment. A quicker payback implies lower liquidity risk.

Question: What does the Payback Period formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{t} CF_i \geq C_0\) signify?
A: The total profit generated by the project over its lifetime is greater than the initial investment.
B: It signifies when cumulative cash inflows match or surpass the initial investment.
C: The formula calculates the total number of cash inflows and outflows.
D: It signifies the projectâ€™s break-even point in terms of sales volume or revenue.
Answer: B
Explanation: The formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{t} CF_i \geq C_0\) for Payback Period signifies the point in time when the cumulative cash inflows from a project equal or exceed the initial investment, indicating when the investment is paid back.

Question: In a project with an initial investment of $100,000 and annual cash inflows of $50,000, what is the Payback Period?
A: 1 year
B: 2 years
C: 3 years
D: 4 years
Answer: B
Explanation: For a project with an initial investment of $100,000 and annual cash inflows of $50,000, the Payback Period is calculated as $100,000 / $50,000/year = 2 years. This means it will take 2 years to recover the initial investment.
