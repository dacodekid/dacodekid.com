# Document Analysis

Document Analysis is an elicitation technique employed to ==scrutinize existing documentation for identifying information== that is pertinent to requirements, business needs, or product information. The technique can serve multiple objectives across different phases and aspects of a project, such as [Needs Assessment](/content/gist/business-analysis/knowledge-areas/needs-assessment.md), [Business Case Assembly](/content/gist/business-analysis/knowledge-areas/needs-assessment.md#assemble-business-case), and [Charter Development](/content/gist/business-analysis/knowledge-areas/needs-assessment.md#support-charter-development).

## Applications in Different Contexts:

1. **Needs Assessment**: During the identification of problems or opportunities, document analysis involves examining various resources like strategic goals and objectives, performance results, customer surveys, and existing processes.

2. **Business Case Assembly**: It aids in compiling a business case by reviewing documentation from diverse sources, particularly the outputs generated from earlier Needs Assessment processes.

3. **Charter Development**: Document analysis can be applied to develop a project or program charter. It could include scrutinizing organizational charts to pinpoint potential stakeholders or evaluating existing business architecture models to understand areas impacted by the proposed change.

## Benefits

- **Objectivity**: Documentation is generally more objective than individual viewpoints.

- **Comprehensiveness**: Documents may encapsulate information that no single individual possesses.

- **Context**: Written documents often provide deeper background and explanations.

- **Efficiency**: Existing documentation can serve as a foundational base, saving time in elicitation activities.

- **Current Information**: Up-to-date documents offer insights into the existing structure and capabilities of a product.

## Cautions

- **Accuracy**: It's essential to ascertain the accuracy and relevancy of the information.

- **Outdated Information**: Historical documentation should be used cautiously and understood in its context.

## Cross-Referencing

- For validating the accuracy of elicitation results, document analysis can be used to compare against historical data or existing materials.
