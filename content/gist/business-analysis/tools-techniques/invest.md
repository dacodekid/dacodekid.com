# INVEST

The INVEST acronym encapsulates the key attributes that good user stories should possess to be considered "ready" for development in adaptive methodologies like Agile and Scrum. INVEST stands for Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable. These criteria serve as a primary verification technique for evaluating the quality and readiness of user stories. Here's a breakdown of each attribute:

## Independent

This characteristic focuses on minimizing dependencies between user stories. The goal is to create stories that can be developed in any sequence without relying on the completion of another story. By doing so, planning becomes more straightforward, allowing teams to prioritize based on value and size rather than being constrained by the order in which stories must be developed.

## Negotiable

This aspect ensures that the details of the user stories remain flexible until they are moved into the development phase. Too much information upfront can restrict the ability for changes and adjustments. The negotiability allows for discussions and adaptations between the development team and business stakeholders until the point the story is accepted for development.

## Valuable

Every user story should provide value either to the business or to the end-user. This aspect ensures that only meaningful work progresses into development phases. User stories in the backlog should be prioritized based on their value to ensure alignment with business objectives.

## Estimable

While maintaining the negotiable characteristic, each story should contain enough detail to allow for a rough size estimate. If the development team is unable to size the story, it indicates that more information is needed. The business analyst is then responsible for further elaboration to reach a level where estimation is possible.

## Small

The size of the user story should be manageable enough to be completed within a single iteration. Stories that are too large need to be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces that fit within the time constraints of a single time-boxed iteration.

## Testable

Lastly, a good user story needs to have clear acceptance criteria to be considered testable. The story should be specific and detailed enough to allow the testing team to create test cases for it. It also ensures that the customer understands what 'done' means for that specific requirement.

Together, these six characteristics offer a comprehensive framework for evaluating the readiness of user stories for development. Properly INVESTed user stories significantly contribute to the efficient and effective progression of adaptive development projects.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: In an Agile project, a business analyst is evaluating a backlog of user stories to determine which ones are ready for development. Which set of criteria should be used to assess the quality and readiness of these user stories?
A: SMART Goals
B: The INVEST Criteria
C: SWOT Analysis
D: The RACI Matrix
Answer: B
Explanation: The INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable) are specifically designed to assess the quality and readiness of user stories in Agile and Scrum methodologies, making them the appropriate set of criteria for this purpose.

Question: Why is it important for user stories to be Independent, as per the INVEST criteria?
A: To ensure they can be developed in any sequence without dependencies
B: To guarantee they are unrelated to the project's goals
C: To allow them to be omitted without impacting the project
D: To make sure they do not require testing
Answer: A
Explanation: The 'Independent' criterion in the INVEST model ensures that user stories can be developed in any sequence, minimizing dependencies. This facilitates easier planning and prioritization based on value and size rather than being constrained by the order of development.

Question: What does the 'Negotiable' aspect of the INVEST criteria imply about user stories?
A: They should have fixed, non-negotiable requirements
B: Their details should remain flexible until they are ready for development
C: They should involve negotiation about the project budget
D: They must be negotiated with external stakeholders only
Answer: B
Explanation: The 'Negotiable' aspect of the INVEST criteria implies that the details of user stories should remain flexible and open to discussion until they are moved into the development phase. This allows for adaptations and changes in response to team and stakeholder discussions.

Question: How does ensuring a user story is Testable, as per the INVEST criteria, contribute to the development process?
A: It confirms that the story is unrelated to the rest of the project
B: It ensures the story is specific and detailed enough for testing
C: It guarantees that the story requires no further refinement
D: It indicates that the story should be tested by external users only
Answer: B
Explanation: A 'Testable' user story, according to the INVEST criteria, is one that is specific and detailed enough to allow the creation of test cases. It ensures that there are clear acceptance criteria, contributing to the clarity and effectiveness of the development and testing processes.

Question: What is the significance of the 'Small' attribute in the INVEST criteria for user stories in Agile projects?
A: It indicates that the story should have a minor impact on the project
B: It ensures the story can be completed within a single iteration
C: It implies that the story should be the smallest in the backlog
D: It means that the story requires minimal resources
Answer: B
Explanation: The 'Small' attribute in the INVEST criteria signifies that a user story should be of a manageable size to be completed within a single iteration. This ensures that stories are sufficiently granular to fit within the time constraints of an iteration.
