# Traceability Matrix

A Traceability Matrix is a tool used to establish and visualize the relationships between various types of requirements, deliverables, and other project or product entities. This matrix serves multiple functions throughout the project life cycle and beyond

### During Validate Requirements

In the validation phase, the Traceability Matrix is used to map requirements to the business objectives they support. This helps ensure that each business objective is sufficiently covered by one or more requirements. Any requirement that doesn't trace back to a business objective is considered a candidate for elimination, as it likely doesn't contribute value to the project and may result in scope creep.

### For Prioritization

The Traceability Matrix can also be a powerful tool for prioritizing requirements. By tracing each requirement to business objectives that have been quantified and ranked, the project team can also prioritize requirements according to their alignment with these high-value objectives. Requirements that are not aligned with business objectives would be considered out of scope and potentially eliminated.

### Comprehensive Tracking

The matrix isn't restricted to just requirements; it can also establish linkages among a variety of project entities like business rules, design elements, implementation details, and test cases. This facilitates comprehensive tracking and scope management throughout the project and product life cycles.

### Adaptability

In adaptive project life cycles, product teams may opt for a more lightweight form of the Traceability Matrix, known as the Interaction Matrix. Unlike the Traceability Matrix, which is maintained over the life of the project, an Interaction Matrix is temporary and captures a specific point in time, allowing for a quicker assessment of the sufficiency and completeness of requirements at that moment.

### Example

Certainly. Below is a Markdown table that captures the relationships between various elements like L1 Process Step, L2 Process Step, Feature, REQID, and Requirement

| L1 Process Step | L2 Process Step | Feature        | REQID | Requirement                        |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| Validate        | Validate Req.   | User Login     | R001  | User must be able to log in        |
| Validate        | Validate Req.   | User Logout    | R002  | User must be able to log out       |
| Prioritize      | Rank Req.       | User Profile   | R003  | User must be able to edit profile  |
| Tracking        | Update Matrix   | Payment        | R004  | User must be able to make payments |
| Adaptability    | Create Matrix   | User Dashboard | R005  | User must see main dashboard       |

This table serves as an example and shows how a Traceability Matrix could be represented. Each row captures a level-1 process step (L1 Process Step), a more specific level-2 process step (L2 Process Step), the feature related to the requirement (Feature), the Requirement ID (REQID), and the Requirement itself.

By serving these multiple functions, a Traceability Matrix becomes an indispensable tool for business analysts and project teams in managing requirements effectively, aligning them with business objectives, and ensuring scope is accurately defined and controlled.
