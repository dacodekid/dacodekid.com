# Feature Injection

Feature Injection is a structured framework aiming to optimize the product development process by concentrating on the most value-added features. This approach is especially popular among teams that leverage adaptive development methodologies. Unlike traditional approaches where extensive information is collected upfront for comprehensive analysis, Feature Injection targets swift value realization by focusing primarily on high-value features. The process of Feature Injection is executed in three key steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Business Value

In this initial stage, the team engages in conversations about the value that the business aims to realize. The discussion may be facilitated by various value models like the Purpose Alignment Model, among others. The objective is to arrive at a collective understanding of the value expected from the product or solution. Once the expected or required value is identified and agreed upon, the team progresses to the next step.

### Step 2: Inject Features

This phase is about identifying or "injecting" those specific features that will help in achieving the business value established in Step 1. The product team collaborates to define the least number of features necessary to deliver the expected value. During this stage, features are often articulated in the form of scenarios, and modeling techniques are employed to facilitate discussions.

### Step 3: Spot Examples

In this final step, the team dives into the details by asking the business to provide examples that may deviate from the scenarios defined in Step 2. The intent here is to unearth any variations or exceptions in processing. The examples provided help the team in developing a shared understanding of all possible scenarios the solution might have to accommodate, thereby expanding the product's scope.

By adhering to this framework, Feature Injection enables teams to focus their efforts on high-value features right from the outset. Furthermore, any discoveries made during this process are harnessed for evaluating various solution options, thereby making the development process more effective and aligned with business value.
