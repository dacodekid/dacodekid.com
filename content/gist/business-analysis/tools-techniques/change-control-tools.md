# Change Control Tools

Change control tools are essential in managing projects, especially those following a predictive lifecycle. These tools, which can be manual or automated, play a crucial role in handling change requests and the decisions that follow. They are often pre-existing within organizations but may also be introduced specifically for a project. It is vital to consider the needs of all stakeholders involved in the change control process when implementing these tools.

## Configuration Management System (CMS)

- **Purpose**: The CMS is designed to ensure that the solution being developed adheres to its approved product information.
- **Process**: It provides a systematic process for verifying solution conformance, documenting changes, and reporting the status of each change throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Components**: Key components of CMS include comprehensive documentation, a tracking process, and defined approval levels for authorizing changes.
- **Management Capability**: It enables the management of changes not only in the context of the specific product but also considering other interdependent products.

## Version Control System (VCS)

- **Functionality**: A VCS is responsible for tracking the revision history of any type of work product.
- **Comparison with Baseline**: It acts similarly to a baseline by establishing an original work product and tracking subsequent modifications.
- **Relation to CMS**: VCS is a part of CMS, representing one of the many functions encompassed by configuration management.

## Further Exploration

For a more detailed discussion on change control tools and their applications in business analysis, refer to Section 5.8.2 of "Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide." This section provides deeper insights into the practical usage and benefits of these tools in managing project changes effectively.

In conclusion, the effective use of change control tools like CMS and VCS in predictive project lifecycles is vital for maintaining the integrity and consistency of project outcomes. These tools ensure that all changes are properly managed, documented, and aligned with the project's overall goals and objectives.
