# Multivoting

Multivoting, often referred to as dot voting, is a prioritization and decision-making technique designed to engage stakeholders actively in the ranking of items, most commonly requirements. The primary advantage of multivoting is its ability to rapidly condense a large list of options into a prioritized list based on collective opinion.

In the application of this technique for business analysis, stakeholders are given a predetermined number of "votes," usually represented by colored dots. Stakeholders place these dots next to the requirements that they consider most crucial or beneficial. Once all votes are cast, the dots are counted, and the requirements are ranked based on the number of votes they've received.

The process is straightforward but effective in democratizing the prioritization process. By aggregating the collective intelligence and preferences of stakeholders, multivoting makes the decision-making process more transparent and participative, thereby increasing buy-in from the involved parties. This is particularly useful in environments where stakeholder consensus is important for the projectâ€™s success.

In terms of similarities to other methods, multivoting is comparable to "buy a feature," where stakeholders allocate their limited resources (votes) to purchase features they consider most valuable. However, while "buy a feature" often involves more complex considerations like budgeting and cost-value trade-offs, multivoting typically focuses solely on preference or priority.

The technique aligns with the broader BA work of requirements prioritization and stakeholder engagement, serving as an effective tool to achieve a consensus or to make more informed decisions on what requirements are of the highest priority. It is particularly useful during the stages of the project where rapid decisions are needed, and it becomes crucial to understand stakeholder priorities in a quick, yet effective, manner.

Question: What is the primary purpose of multivoting in business analysis?
A: To assign specific tasks to stakeholders based on their expertise and availability.
B: To engage stakeholders in rapidly prioritizing requirements through collective opinion.
C: To create a detailed budget for each requirement based on cost-value analysis.
D: To finalize the project timeline and schedule based on stakeholder preferences.
Answer: B
Explanation: Multivoting is used to engage stakeholders in a rapid and participative way to prioritize requirements or options. It leverages collective opinion to form a prioritized list, enhancing the decision-making process.

Question: How does the multivoting process differ from the "buy a feature" technique in stakeholder engagement?
A: Multivoting involves complex budgeting and cost-value analysis, unlike "buy a feature."
B: It emphasizes stakeholders' preferences without complex budgeting like "buy a feature."
C: Multivoting does not involve stakeholder participation, whereas "buy a feature" does through a voting process.
D: There is no difference; both techniques are identical in their application.
Answer: B
Explanation: Multivoting is primarily about stakeholders expressing their preferences or priorities, often through a simple voting process. In contrast, "buy a feature" involves more complex considerations, like budgeting and cost-value trade-offs.

Question: Why is multivoting considered an effective tool for stakeholder engagement?
A: Because it limits stakeholder participation to only high-ranking individuals in the organization.
B: It democratizes the decision-making process, making it more transparent and participative.
C: It only allows project managers to vote, thereby speeding up the decision process.
D: Multivoting is used to delegate tasks, not for decision-making or stakeholder engagement.
Answer: B
Explanation: Multivoting is effective for stakeholder engagement as it democratizes the decision-making process. By involving stakeholders actively in prioritizing items, it makes the process more transparent and encourages wider participation.

Question: In what scenario is multivoting particularly useful in a project?
A: When detailed and long-term project planning is required to finalize the project scope.
B: In stages requiring rapid decisions and understanding stakeholder priorities.
C: When the project does not require stakeholder input or consensus on requirements.
D: Only in the final stages of the project for retrospective analysis and feedback.
Answer: B
Explanation: Multivoting is especially useful during project stages that require rapid decision-making and a clear understanding of stakeholder priorities. It facilitates quick yet effective consensus-building on important matters.

Question: How does multivoting contribute to the prioritization of requirements?
A: It restricts stakeholders from expressing their preferences on requirements to only a few.
B: By voting, it ranks requirements based on collective priority from stakeholder opinions.
C: It assigns monetary values to each requirement.
D: Multivoting is only used for final approval of the project plan, not for prioritizing requirements.
Answer: B
Explanation: Multivoting contributes to requirement prioritization by allowing stakeholders to vote on the requirements they find most crucial. This aggregation of opinions helps in ranking requirements based on their collective priority.
