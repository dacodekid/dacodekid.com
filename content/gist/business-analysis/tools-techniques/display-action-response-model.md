# Display-Action-Response Model

The Display-Action-Response (DAR) model is a tool used in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) to describe the interactions between a user and a system. While the DAR model is not explicitly outlined in PMI's Guide to Business Analysis, it can serve as a useful framework for business analysts to understand and document the system's behavior from the user's perspective.

## Components of the Display-Action-Response Model

- **Display**: This refers to what the user sees on the screen. It includes everything from text and graphics to buttons and other interactive elements. The display provides the user with the context and options for what can be done within a specific interface or part of the system.

- **Action**: This component focuses on what the user does in response to the display. Actions could be as simple as clicking a button or as complex as entering data into multiple fields. The action is essentially the user's interaction with the system based on what is displayed.

- **Response**: This is how the system reacts to the user's action. Responses can be immediate or delayed and may involve changes to the display, performing computations, or triggering other actions. The response provides the user with feedback about the action they have taken.

## When to Use DAR

- **System Design & Prototyping**: DAR is commonly used during the design and prototyping stages to plan out the flow of interactions within the system.
- **User Experience Testing**: Business analysts can employ the DAR model to create test scenarios to evaluate how intuitive and responsive a system is from the user's perspective.
- **Documentation**: The DAR model can be used to create comprehensive documentation that captures the flow of user interactions, helping stakeholders understand the system's behavior.

## Relationship to Business Analysis

- **Requirements Elicitation and Analysis**: Understanding the user-system interactions can help in eliciting more precise functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Traceability**: The DAR model helps trace user interactions back to specific requirements, providing a clear path from needs to features.

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: By framing the system's behavior in terms of display, action, and response, it's easier for stakeholders to understand the system's functionalities, thereby facilitating clearer communication.

In summary, the DAR model offers a structured approach to understand and document the interactions between a user and a system, thereby aiding in better design, testing, and implementation. It can be a useful addition to the toolbox of a business analyst working on system development projects.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: A business analyst is working on enhancing the user interface of a software application. To ensure the interface is intuitive and user-friendly, which model should be employed to analyze and document the interactions between the user and the system?
A: SWOT Analysis
B: Gantt Chart
C: Display-Action-Response (DAR) Model
D: Fishbone Diagram
Answer: C
Explanation: The Display-Action-Response (DAR) Model is a tool used to describe the interactions between a user and a system, focusing on what the user sees, does, and how the system responds. It is ideal for analyzing and documenting user interface interactions.

Question: In the context of the DAR model, what does the 'Display' component refer to?
A: The project timeline displayed to the management team
B: The cost display for the project budget and expenses
C: What the user sees on the screen, including text and interactive elements
D: The data display in project status reports and dashboards to stakeholders
Answer: C
Explanation: In the DAR model, the 'Display' component refers to what the user sees on the screen, such as text, graphics, buttons, and other interactive elements that provide context and options for interaction.

Question: How does the DAR model assist in user experience testing?
A: By creating financial reports for the user interface design team
B: By planning the project schedule for user testing activities to be conducted
C: By creating test scenarios to evaluate the system's intuitiveness and responsiveness
D: By assigning roles for user testing activities to be conducted
Answer: C
Explanation: The DAR model is useful in user experience testing as it helps create test scenarios that evaluate how intuitive and responsive a system is from the user's perspective, focusing on the display, action, and response.

Question: What aspect of business analysis is directly supported by the use of the DAR model?
A: Budgeting and financial analysis of the project
B: Requirements elicitation and analysis
C: Staffing and resource allocation for the project
D: Marketing and sales strategy
Answer: B
Explanation: The DAR model directly supports requirements elicitation and analysis in business analysis. Understanding the user-system interactions through the DAR model helps in eliciting more precise functional and non-functional requirements.

Question: In the Display-Action-Response model, what is the 'Response' component primarily concerned with?
A: How the user feels about the system interaction
B: The system's reaction to the user's action
C: The response time of the project team
D: The feedback from stakeholders about the system
Answer: B
Explanation: In the DAR model, the 'Response' component is concerned with how the system reacts to the user's action, which can involve changes to the display, computations, or triggering other actions, providing feedback about the user's interaction.
