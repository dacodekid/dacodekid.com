# Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)

Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is a prioritization method predominantly used in adaptive frameworks like Agile and SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework). This technique goes beyond traditional methods that typically use only business value and effort to prioritize backlog items. WSJF incorporates multiple dimensions to derive a comprehensive weighted value that helps in deciding the order in which user stories or features should be developed.

## Four Dimensions in WSJF

1. **Business Value**: Represents the perceived value that the story will deliver to the business. High business value implies that the feature is essential for achieving business goals or objectives.

2. **Time Criticality**: This measures the importance of implementing the user story within a specific time frame. Some features may lose their value if they are not developed promptly.

3. **Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement**: This dimension captures the potential of a user story to mitigate risks or to capitalize on new opportunities. These could be technical risks, market risks, or other types of risks/opportunities that could affect the project or business.

4. **Effort**: This represents the amount of work required to implement the user story, often estimated in story points or days.

## WSJF Calculation

The WSJF is calculated using a formula which is:

$$
\text{WSJF} = \frac{{\text{Business Value} + \text{Time Criticality} + (\text{Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement})}}{\text{Effort}}
$$

This formula integrates all four dimensions into a single numerical value, enabling a more nuanced prioritization of the backlog items.

## Fibonacci Sequence in Estimation

In many cases, the Fibonacci sequence is used in a similar way to estimation poker for sizing these dimensions. The sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) offers a convenient way to arrive at these estimates because it accounts for the inherent uncertainty in estimating, particularly as the size or complexity of the task increases.

## Application in Adaptive Frameworks

In adaptive project frameworks, such as Agile or SAFe, WSJF becomes particularly useful for sorting out the product backlog or program backlog items. It enables teams and product owners to focus on features that offer the highest value against the least effort while considering time constraints and risks or opportunities. It is an essential tool for business analysts, product owners, and other stakeholders involved in prioritization and decision-making in adaptive environments.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary purpose of the Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) method in Agile frameworks?
A: To extend project timelines.
B: To prioritize backlog items by incorporating multiple dimensions like business value, time criticality, risk/opportunity, and effort.
C: It is used solely for financial budgeting of projects.
D: To manage the personal schedules of the development team.
Answer: B
Explanation: The primary purpose of the Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) method in Agile and other adaptive frameworks is to prioritize backlog items effectively. It incorporates multiple dimensions, including business value, time criticality, risk reduction/opportunity enablement, and effort, to derive a comprehensive weighted value. This helps in deciding the order in which user stories or features should be developed.

Question: How does the WSJF method calculate prioritization for backlog items?
A: By focusing solely on the effort required.
B: WSJF prioritization is calculated using the formula: (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement) / Effort.
C: The calculation is based on the personal preference of the product owner.
D: It only considers the business value.
Answer: B
Explanation: The WSJF method calculates the prioritization of backlog items using the formula: (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement) / Effort. This formula integrates all four dimensions into a single numerical value, enabling a nuanced prioritization approach.

Question: Why is the Fibonacci sequence used in WSJF estimation?
A: The Fibonacci sequence is irrelevant in WSJF estimation.
B: The Fibonacci sequence is used as it offers a convenient way to estimate dimensions, accounting for the inherent uncertainty in estimating.
C: It is used for its aesthetic appeal in presentations.
D: The sequence is used only to complicate the estimation process.
Answer: B
Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence is often used in WSJF estimation because it provides a structured yet flexible way to estimate the dimensions of business value, time criticality, risk/opportunity, and effort. The sequence accounts for the inherent uncertainty in estimating, particularly for larger or more complex tasks.

Question: In which project frameworks is WSJF particularly useful?
A: It is only useful in waterfall project management.
B: WSJF is particularly useful in adaptive project frameworks like Agile or SAFe.
C: The method is exclusively used in financial management frameworks.
D: WSJF is only applicable in manufacturing processes.
Answer: B
Explanation: Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is particularly useful in adaptive project frameworks such as Agile and the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). In these environments, WSJF helps teams and product owners to prioritize features in the backlog that offer the highest value against the least effort while considering time constraints and risks or opportunities.

Question: What role does WSJF play in decision-making for business analysts and product owners?
A: WSJF plays no role in their decision-making process.
B: WSJF is an essential tool for business analysts and product owners in prioritization and decision-making, focusing on high-value features with consideration to time and effort.
C: It is only used for deciding team holidays.
D: WSJF is used to determine the salaries of team members.
Answer: B
Explanation: For business analysts and product owners, the Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) method is an essential tool in the decision-making process. It aids in prioritizing features and user stories in the product backlog by focusing on those that offer the highest value in relation to effort, while also considering factors like time criticality and potential risks or opportunities.
