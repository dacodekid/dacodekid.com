# Use Case

Use cases serve as process models that employ textual narratives to elucidate the interactions between a system and its users for achieving a specific goal. They are an essential tool in the realm of business analysis, commonly utilized for identifying and elaborating on requirements. Let's delve deeper into the constituents, purposes, and best practices associated with use cases.

## Anatomy of a Use Case

### Goal and Naming

The overarching objective that the primary actor aims to accomplish is denoted as the 'goal' of the use case. It is customary for this goal to form part of the use case's name, usually articulated as a verb phrase.

### Normal Flow

The 'normal flow' refers to the most frequent pattern of interactions between the system and the user. It encapsulates the standard course of actions and reactions that occur under typical conditions.

### Alternative and Exception Flows

Aside from the normal flow, a use case also encapsulates 'alternative and exception flows.' These represent the various paths that deviate from the normal flow due to specific conditions or exceptions.

### Common Fields

Commonly included fields in a use case might consist of:

- **Name**: As mentioned, a verb phrase that clearly defines the goal.
- **Description**: A succinct account of what the use case entails.
- **Actors**: The roles that will actively partake in executing the use case.
- **Organizational Benefit**: A rationale illustrating the significance of the use case for either the project or the broader organization.
- **Trigger**: Specifies the event initiating the use case.
- **Preconditions**: Outlines the prerequisites that must be met for the use case to commence successfully.

## Creation and Timing

Use cases are often formulated subsequent to the development of process flows. This sequencing facilitates the provision of supplementary details for specific steps in those process flows, especially when the interactions between the system and users are intricate. Nonetheless, use cases can also stand alone and be developed in lieu of process flows.

## Types of Requirements Addressed

Use cases are primarily employed to identify functional requirements but can also specify nonfunctional requirements or acceptance criteria. However, it's essential to note that nonfunctional aspects, like system speed or durability, are usually not incorporated into the use case itself but are documented separately.

## Representation and Documentation

Textual use cases can either be represented through a standardized document template or take a tabular form featuring standardized columns. The chosen format would hinge on the particular needs of the project and stakeholders involved.

## Practical Applications

Use cases are especially useful when transitioning from business requirements to stakeholder requirements or even to solution requirements. They serve as a detailed roadmap outlining the steps and conditions necessary for the successful completion of a goal.

## Conclusion

Use Cases offer a structured framework to capture, represent, and analyze the dynamic interactions between systems and their users. By detailing the normal, alternative, and exception flows, along with critical attributes like triggers and preconditions, use cases serve as invaluable assets in the meticulous process of requirements gathering and elaboration.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary function of a use case in business analysis?
A: To serve as a financial ledger for the project.
B: To provide detailed narratives of system-user interactions for achieving specific goals, identifying and elaborating on requirements.
C: It is used solely for scheduling project timelines.
D: To record the personal information of project team members.
Answer: B
Explanation: The primary function of a use case in business analysis is to provide a structured, detailed narrative that elucidates the interactions between a system and its users aimed at achieving a specific goal. Use cases play a crucial role in identifying and elaborating on requirements, both functional and nonfunctional.

Question: How does the 'normal flow' in a use case contribute to understanding system interactions?
A: It only details the financial transactions within the system.
B: The 'normal flow' outlines the most frequent pattern of interactions under typical conditions, providing insight into standard system-user dynamics.
C: Normal flow is irrelevant in use cases.
D: It exclusively focuses on the technical architecture of the system.
Answer: B
Explanation: In a use case, the 'normal flow' is critical as it describes the most common or expected sequence of interactions between the system and the user under typical conditions. This helps in understanding the standard course of actions and reactions, providing a clear view of the system-user interaction dynamics.

Question: What types of requirements are primarily addressed by use cases?
A: Only financial requirements.
B: Use cases are predominantly used to identify functional requirements but can also specify nonfunctional requirements or acceptance criteria.
C: They exclusively address legal requirements.
D: Use cases are only for aesthetic design requirements.
Answer: B
Explanation: Use cases are primarily employed to capture and articulate functional requirements. However, they can also be used to specify nonfunctional requirements or acceptance criteria, though nonfunctional aspects are typically documented separately.

Question: When are use cases typically formulated in the business analysis process?
A: After the project has been completed.
B: Use cases are often created after process flows have been developed, providing additional details for specific steps in the process.
C: They are only formulated at the start of the project.
D: Use cases are never formulated; they are assumed.
Answer: B
Explanation: Use cases are typically formulated after the development of process flows. This timing allows for the provision of detailed insights and supplementary information for specific steps within those process flows, enhancing the understanding of complex system-user interactions.

Question: In what format can textual use cases be represented?
A: Exclusively in a pictorial format.
B: Textual use cases can be represented through a standardized document template or in a tabular form with standardized columns.
C: They are only represented in a video format.
D: Use cases are represented in a purely verbal format without documentation.
Answer: B
Explanation: Textual use cases can be documented in various formats, including a standardized document template or a tabular form with standardized columns. The choice of format depends on the specific needs of the project and the preferences of stakeholders involved, aiming for clear and effective communication of the requirements.
