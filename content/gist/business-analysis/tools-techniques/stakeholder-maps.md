# Stakeholder Maps

Stakeholder maps are valuable tools in business analysis and project management, helping to identify and analyze the relationships of stakeholders to a project or solution. Here, we'll delve into a few key techniques, each under its own header.

## [Stakeholder Matrix](./stakeholder-matrix.md)

### Overview

The Stakeholder Matrix is a quadrant-based analysis tool. It's used to categorize stakeholders based on two key variables: Influence and Impact.

### Axes Definition

- **X-Axis (Influence):** This axis assesses how much a stakeholder can affect project requirements or outcomes.
- **Y-Axis (Impact):** This measures how significantly the project or solution impacts the stakeholder.

### Quadrants

- **High Influence/Low Impact:** These are often decision-makers who don’t directly feel the project's effects but can sway its direction.
- **High Influence/High Impact:** Critical stakeholders with significant requirements contributions. They are deeply affected by the project and have considerable influence over it.
- **Low Influence/Low Impact:** Often peripheral stakeholders. Their needs might be addressed last or not at all, but they should be monitored for any change in their relationship to the project.
- **Low Influence/High Impact:** While they don’t hold much sway, these stakeholders are significantly affected by the project. Their needs are crucial to understand and address.

## [Onion Diagram](./onion-diagram.md)

### Overview

The Onion Diagram is a layered representation of stakeholder relationships, resembling the layers of an onion.

### Layers Explanation

- **Inner Layers:** These represent stakeholders closely involved with the project, such as project team members or immediate clients.
- **Middle Layers:** Typically include stakeholders who are not directly involved in the project but have some influence or interest, such as department heads or indirect users.
- **Outer Layers:** Encompass stakeholders with a more distant, but still relevant, connection to the project. Examples might include regulatory bodies or the general public.

## Power/Interest Grid

### Overview

This grid categorizes stakeholders based on their power over and interest in the project.

### Quadrants

- **High Power/High Interest:** Key players who require close attention and regular engagement.
- **High Power/Low Interest:** Keep these stakeholders satisfied but not overloaded with information, as they have the power to impact the project but low interest in its daily workings.
- **Low Power/High Interest:** Keep these stakeholders adequately informed and engaged, as they have a high interest but limited power.
- **Low Power/Low Interest:** Monitor these stakeholders, but they typically require less focus due to their low impact and interest.

## Stakeholder Engagement Matrix

### Overview

This matrix helps in planning how to engage with stakeholders based on their current and required levels of engagement.

### Categories

- **Unaware:** Stakeholders who are unaware of the project and might need to be informed.
- **Resistant:** Those opposed to the project, requiring strategies to win over or neutralize their opposition.
- **Neutral:** Stakeholders who are indifferent and might need to be kept informed or moved to a more supportive stance.
- **Supportive:** Stakeholders who are supportive of the project, to be kept engaged and possibly used as advocates.
- **Leading:** These stakeholders are actively engaged and can be leveraged to influence others positively.

## Conclusion

Each of these techniques serves a unique purpose in stakeholder analysis. The choice of which to use depends on the specific needs of the project and the nature of its stakeholders. Understanding and applying these methods can significantly enhance project outcomes by ensuring stakeholders are appropriately identified, understood, and engaged.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary purpose of using the Stakeholder Matrix in Stakeholder Analysis?
A: To create a detailed project budget including budgeting and forecasting
B: To identify stakeholders based on their level of technical expertise
C: To categorize stakeholders based on their Influence and Impact on the project
D: To determine the exact communication frequency with each stakeholder
Answer: C
Explanation: The Stakeholder Matrix is used to categorize stakeholders based on two key variables: Influence (the ability to affect project requirements or outcomes) and Impact (how significantly the stakeholder is affected by the project).

Question: In the context of the Onion Diagram, who would typically be included in the outer layers?
A: Project team members and immediate clients of the project
B: Immediate clients of the project and department heads
C: Stakeholders with a distant but relevant connection
D: Department heads involved in the project
Answer: C
Explanation: In the Onion Diagram, the outer layers encompass stakeholders with a more distant, yet still relevant, connection to the project, such as regulatory bodies or the general public.

Question: Which category in the Stakeholder Engagement Matrix describes stakeholders who are actively engaged and can influence others positively?
A: Unaware
B: Neutral
C: Supportive
D: Leading
Answer: D
Explanation: In the Stakeholder Engagement Matrix, 'Leading' stakeholders are those who are actively engaged in the project and can be leveraged to positively influence other stakeholders.

Question: What is the key distinction between stakeholders categorized as High Power/Low Interest and Low Power/High Interest in the Power/Interest Grid?
A: The High Power/Low Interest stakeholders require regular project updates, while the Low Power/High Interest stakeholders do not.
B: The High Power/Low Interest stakeholders have the power to impact the project but a low interest in its daily workings, whereas Low Power/High Interest stakeholders have high interest but limited power.
C: High Power/Low Interest stakeholders are decision-makers, while Low Power/High Interest stakeholders are typically project team members.
D: There is no significant difference in how these two groups are managed.
Answer: B
Explanation: In the Power/Interest Grid, High Power/Low Interest stakeholders have the power to impact the project but low interest in its daily workings, requiring satisfaction but not information overload. Low Power/High Interest stakeholders have a high interest but limited power, necessitating adequate information and engagement.

Question: Which quadrant in the Stakeholder Matrix includes stakeholders who are deeply affected by the project and have considerable influence over it?
A: High Influence/Low Impact
B: High Influence/High Impact
C: Low Influence/Low Impact
D: Low Influence/High Impact
Answer: B
Explanation: The High Influence/High Impact quadrant in the Stakeholder Matrix includes critical stakeholders who have significant requirements contributions, are deeply affected by the project, and have considerable influence over it.
