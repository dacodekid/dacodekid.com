# Focus Groups

Focus groups are a specialized elicitation technique used for gathering qualitative data and insights from prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts (SMEs). They are typically employed to understand the expectations, attitudes, and opinions about a proposed solution, as well as different design options.

### Objectives and Usage

- **Understanding Expectations and Attitudes**: The primary objective of a focus group is to learn about the attitudes and expectations of the stakeholders and SMEs towards a proposed solution. It serves as a mechanism for direct engagement with customers and/or end users.

- **Design Options**: Focus groups can also be instrumental in eliciting attitudes and opinions regarding various design options. This is especially useful when multiple solutions are viable, and stakeholder input is essential for making an informed decision.

### Characteristics

- **Prequalified Participants**: One of the critical aspects of focus groups is the selection of participants. Participants are prequalified, meaning they have specific knowledge, experience, or stake in the subject being discussed.

- **Facilitation**: Similar to facilitated workshops, focus groups are also managed by a facilitator. The role of the facilitator is crucial in ensuring healthy team dynamics and a free flow of ideas.

- **Qualitative Feedback**: The feedback collected is often qualitative and nuanced, making it valuable for understanding the subjective aspects that might not be captured through other elicitation techniques.

- **Session Objectives**: The facilitator ensures that the session meets its objectives by guiding the discussion and ensuring that sufficient levels of feedback are obtained.

### Applications

Focus groups are often used in various stages of business analysis, including but not limited to:

- **Requirements Elicitation**: To understand what stakeholders and SMEs expect from a proposed solution.

- **Solution Evaluation**: To gauge stakeholder reactions to different design options and thus assist in the decision-making process.

- **Feedback Loop**: As a mechanism to get direct feedback from end-users or customers, thereby adding a layer of validation to the analysis and decision-making process.

Thus, focus groups are an effective tool for capturing the subjective viewpoints and attitudes of stakeholders, providing valuable input that complements other forms of data and analysis.
