# Requirements Management Tool

A Requirements Management Tool is a specialized software or system used in the Business Analysis process to facilitate the capture, storage, and management of requirements and associated product information. The tool acts as a centralized repository where requirements are logged along with their status, any associated attribute values, and related models. This repository can potentially house the contents of a requirements package, particularly depending on the approach taken for the project life cycle.

## Functionalities

Requirements Management Tools typically offer a variety of functionalities aimed at streamlining the requirements management process:

- **Audit Trails and Version Control**: These features support change management by maintaining a history of alterations made to the requirements, who made them, and when they were made.

- **Workflow Functionality**: The tool usually supports the review and approval processes, often by enabling a workflow that can route the requirements to the appropriate stakeholders for review and sign-off.

- **Visual Models and Prototypes**: Certain tools have built-in capabilities for generating visual models or interactive prototypes that can facilitate a deeper understanding of the requirements.

- **Team Collaboration**: They often include features that enable team members to collaborate within the tool itself, sometimes integrating with other communication tools or platforms.

- **Office Productivity Integration**: These tools commonly offer integration with office productivity software (like MS Office), making it easier to import/export data.

- **Status Tracking and Reporting**: The tool often allows for tracking the status of individual requirements and may generate reports summarizing the status of all requirements.

- **Traceability**: The tool generally provides functionalities to establish and track trace links between requirements, test cases, source code, and other artifacts.

In the context of adaptive projects, additional features might be included such as the ability to manage product and iteration backlogs and to generate product burndown charts.

## Limitations

It's crucial to note that a Requirements Management Tool in itself does not contribute to the definition of high-quality product information. Its primary role is as a storage and management facility.

## Selection Criteria

Choosing the appropriate Requirements Management Tool can sometimes pose challenges. The tool should be evaluated based on its alignment with organizational needs to increase the likelihood of successful adoption. Capabilities for supporting traceability are commonly considered essential features in current requirements management tools.

Overall, a Requirements Management Tool is integral to an effective Business Analysis process, offering various functionalities that aid in the capturing, tracking, and management of product requirements.
