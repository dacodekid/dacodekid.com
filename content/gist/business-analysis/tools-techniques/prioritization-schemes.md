# Prioritization Schemes

Prioritization schemes are essential tools in business analysis, employed for ordering requirements, features, and various product details. These schemes become particularly vital when managing transitions, whether due to the complexity of requirements, the need to accommodate multiple sites, or the sheer volume of transition necessities.

## Core Principles

### Purpose and Application

These methods are utilized across various domains - from handling portfolio components and projects to managing specific product features. The goal is to systematically identify and rank the importance and urgency of different elements within a project or process.

### Areas of Usage

1. **Transition Management**: Useful in segmenting transitions, especially when dealing with complex or numerous requirements.
2. **Portfolio and Project Prioritization**: Helps in prioritizing various aspects of portfolios, programs, and projects.
3. **Solution Performance Evaluation**: Aids in ranking the value of benefits and challenges of a solution, thereby assessing its overall effectiveness.

## Common Techniques

1. **Buy a Feature**: A collaborative game where stakeholders use pretend money to buy features. The most funded features are prioritized.
2. **Delphi Method**: Involves anonymous input from SMEs, consolidated through a facilitator, aiming to build consensus without peer pressure.
3. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Focuses on releasing the most basic version of a product that still delivers value, aiming for quick market entry.
4. **MoSCoW Method**: Categorizes requirements into Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have.
5. **Multivoting**: Stakeholders vote on important requirements using a set number of dots or votes.
6. **Purpose Alignment Model**: Categorizes options based on their alignment with business purposes.
7. **Timeboxing**: Involves prioritizing tasks that can be completed within a set time frame.
8. **Weighted Ranking**: Items are rated based on decision criteria, with weighted scores determining their priority.
9. **Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)**: Ranks user stories by considering business value, time criticality, risk reduction, and effort.

## Conclusion

Prioritization schemes are indispensable in business analysis for effectively managing and executing projects. Understanding and applying these techniques can lead to more efficient decision-making and better alignment of projects with strategic business objectives. For further details and examples, referring to specialized sections in business analysis guides is recommended.
