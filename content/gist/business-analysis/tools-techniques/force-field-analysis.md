# Force Field Analysis

Force Field Analysis is a decision-making technique focused on identifying and evaluating the various forces that can affect a proposed change. By carefully assessing these forces, the product team can gauge the viability of implementing the change within an organizational context. Here's a deeper look at the process and components:

### Components of Force Field Analysis:

1. **Description of Change**: The change under consideration is described and placed centrally in the model, serving as the focal point.

2. **Positive Forces**: These are the factors that support the proposed change. They are listed on the left side of the model.

3. **Negative Forces**: These are the impediments or resistances against the change. They are listed on the right side of the model.

4. **Weighting of Forces**: Each force, whether positive or negative, is assigned a weight. The weight reflects the force's significance and the ease with which it can be influenced.

### Steps to Conduct Force Field Analysis:

1. **Identify Change**: Clearly state the change that is being considered.

2. **List Forces**: Identify all the forces for and against the change.

3. **Assign Weights**: Weights are assigned to each force based on its impact and influenceability.

4. **Tally Scores**: The weights of the forces are summed separately for both the positive and negative sides.

5. **Analyze and Decide**: If the positive forces outweigh the negative forces, then there is organizational support to proceed with the change. Conversely, if negative forces are dominant, the change is less likely to be successful.

### Applications in Decision Making:

- **Evaluating Organizational Support**: The total scores give an indication of whether there is sufficient organizational backing for the change.

- **Strategic Planning**: By understanding the balance of forces, the team can create strategies to either strengthen positive forces or mitigate negative ones.

- **Risk Management**: Identifying the negative forces can help in formulating risk mitigation plans.

### Advantages and Disadvantages:

**Advantages**:

- Provides a structured approach to evaluate complex decisions.
- Facilitates team discussions and consensus-building.

**Disadvantages**:

- Subjectivity in assigning weights can lead to biased outcomes.
- Doesn't provide a solution, but only an analysis of the situation.

By applying Force Field Analysis, teams can have a structured framework to assess the feasibility of a proposed change, considering both its advantages and the challenges it may encounter. This technique provides a comprehensive view that aids in making more informed decisions.

### Example:

```
                          Proposed Change
                        -------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Positive Forces |  Force 1 (Weight 5)                 | Negative Forces | Force A (Weight 2)
                |  Force 2 (Weight 3)                 |                 | Force B (Weight 4)
                |                                     |
                |                                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                |  Total = 8                          |                 | Total = 6
```

In this example:

- The proposed change is placed in the center of the model.

- Positive Forces that support the change are listed on the left side, each with their respective weights. The total weight is summed at the bottom.

- Negative Forces that resist the change are listed on the right side, each also with their respective weights. Their total weight is summed at the bottom as well.

In this case, the sum of Positive Forces (8) outweighs the sum of Negative Forces (6), indicating that there is sufficient organizational support to proceed with the change.
