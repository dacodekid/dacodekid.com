# Prototyping

Prototyping is an elicitation technique that allows for early feedback on requirements by creating a tangible model or proof of concept (PoC) of the expected solution. ==Unlike traditional methods== that rely on abstract representations of requirements, ==prototyping offers stakeholders a more concrete, visual way to understand== and interact with a proposed solution. This hands-on approach provides a valuable means to validate whether the conceptual solution aligns well with the existing set of requirements and helps to identify any potential gaps.

Prototyping embraces the idea of progressive elaboration, involving iterative cycles of creating mockups, allowing user interaction, gathering feedback, and then refining the prototype. The prototype can be anything from a simple architectural model to an early version of the product itself. Through this iterative process, requirements can be refined and more closely aligned with stakeholder expectations and needs.

## [Evolutionary Prototyping](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/evolutionary-prototyping.md)

Evolutionary Prototyping is a technique where a model of the system is built and refined iteratively based on stakeholder feedback, until it evolves into the final product.

## [Storyboarding](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/storyboarding.md)

Storyboarding involves creating a series of illustrations or images displayed in sequence to pre-visualize a solution or to illustrate a process flow. It is often used to flesh out user stories, describe user journeys, or define scenarios for system interactions.

## [Wireframes](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/wireframes.md)

Wireframes are low-fidelity, simplified outlines or schematics of what a software screen will look like. They help to convey the structure, layout, and information architecture of the software, providing a visual guide for stakeholders and developers.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary advantage of using Prototyping as an elicitation technique in business analysis?
A: To create a legal framework for the project development
B: To provide early feedback on requirements through a tangible model or PoC
C: To finalize the project budget and allocate resources
D: To conduct performance appraisals of team members involved in the project
Answer: B
Explanation: Prototyping allows stakeholders to interact with a tangible model or proof of concept (PoC) of the expected solution, offering early feedback on requirements and helping to identify potential gaps.

Question: What characterizes Evolutionary Prototyping in business analysis?
A: A model is built once and never changed or refined
B: A prototype, shaped by stakeholder feedback, incrementally becomes the final product
C: It involves creating a prototype without any stakeholder input or feedback whatsoever
D: It focuses solely on the financial aspects of a project and its deliverables
Answer: B
Explanation: Evolutionary Prototyping involves creating a model that is continuously refined through iterative cycles based on stakeholder feedback, eventually evolving into the final product.

Question: What is the main objective of Storyboarding in prototyping?
A: To visually map a system's workflow or user path sequentially
B: To calculate the return on investment for the project deliverables and stakeholders
C: To outline the projectâ€™s financial budget and resource allocation plan
D: To design the organization's website and mobile app
Answer: A
Explanation: Storyboarding aims to create a visual guide that represents the sequence of actions or steps a user will take, helping in understanding and planning system functionality and user interaction.

Question: What is a primary use of Wireframes in the context of prototyping?
A: To sketch a digital product's basic layout and functional details
B: To assess the market viability of a product or service offering
C: To conduct a risk assessment for the project deliverables and stakeholders
D: To draft legal contracts for the project stakeholders and vendors
Answer: A
Explanation: Wireframes are used to establish the architecture and layout of a page or system, providing a visual guide on how elements are arranged and interact, focusing on layout design and functional specifications.

Question: How does Evolutionary Prototyping contribute to risk mitigation in project development?
A: By ensuring all legal requirements are met for the project
B: Its iterative approach and continuous feedback enable early issue detection
C: By focusing solely on the aesthetic design of the product or service
D: By conducting financial audits of the project deliverables and stakeholders
Answer: B
Explanation: The incremental nature and constant feedback loops in Evolutionary Prototyping make it easier to identify and address issues early in the project, reducing the risks of late failure.

Question: In what way does Storyboarding aid in the requirements process?
A: It mainly assists in hiring project team members and allocating resources to the project
B: By making system interactions tangible, it clarifies and refines requirements
C: By focusing on the distribution of profits from the product or service offering
D: By drafting legal agreements for stakeholders
Answer: B
Explanation: Storyboarding helps clarify and refine requirements by providing a visual representation of system behavior and user interactions, aiding in the identification of gaps and the elicitation of requirements.
