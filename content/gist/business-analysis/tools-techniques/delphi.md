# Delphi

The Delphi technique is a consensus-building approach specifically designed to gather information and arrive at a collective agreement among a group of subject matter experts (SMEs). This technique is particularly beneficial in the validation of requirements, among other applications such as prioritization and estimation.

## Process Overview

1. **Initiation**: A facilitator initiates the process, usually by sending out a questionnaire to the SMEs. The questionnaire aims to elicit opinions, feedback, or insights about a particular subjectâ€”most commonly requirements validity in the context of business analysis.

2. **Anonymity**: One of the key features is the anonymous participation of experts, which serves to reduce bias and eliminates undue influence from any individual SME.

3. **Summary and Redistribution**: After the first round of responses, the facilitator summarizes the collected data and redistributes it to the SMEs for another round of comments.

4. **Iterative Rounds**: This step is repeated in multiple rounds until the feedback starts to converge towards a consensus. The number of rounds may vary based on the complexity of the subject and the level of initial disagreement among the experts.

5. **Consensus**: The aim is to reach a consensus. If a consensus is achieved, the results are then documented and used as agreed upon, whether that be for validating requirements, prioritizing features, or any other decision-making process.

## Key Benefits

- **Reduction of Bias**: The anonymity and iterative nature of the process work to reduce individual biases and undue influence, which might otherwise skew the results.

- **Data Integrity**: The iterative rounds and summarized feedback serve to refine and improve the quality of the collective wisdom, ultimately aimed at a more reliable consensus.

- **Informed Decision-making**: With input from multiple SMEs, decisions based on Delphi technique results are generally well-rounded and thoroughly considered.

## Key Applications

- **Validate Requirements**: In the requirements validation phase, SMEs can use the Delphi technique to collectively agree on the validity and sufficiency of the proposed requirements.

- **Estimation and Prioritization**: Delphi can also be employed for making more accurate estimations, and for prioritizing requirements, features, or user stories.

- **Design Options**: When multiple design solutions are possible, the Delphi technique can aid in choosing the most feasible or effective one.

In conclusion, the Delphi technique is a robust method for achieving a high-quality consensus within a group of experts, particularly useful in scenarios where bias and influence can be detrimental to the decision-making process.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary purpose of the Delphi technique in business analysis?
A: To provide a detailed financial analysis of a project
B: To gather information and reach a consensus among subject matter experts
C: To serve as a legal contract between experts and the organization
D: To focus solely on the technical aspects of a project and its components
Answer: B
Explanation: The primary purpose of the Delphi technique in business analysis is to gather information and arrive at a collective agreement among a group of subject matter experts (SMEs). This consensus-building approach is particularly beneficial in validating requirements, prioritizing features, and making estimations.

Question: How does anonymity contribute to the effectiveness of the Delphi technique?
A: It ensures financial confidentiality for participants.
B: It reduces bias and undue influence from individual experts.
C: It provides a legal shield for participants in case of disputes.
D: It focuses on the technical skills of the participants.
Answer: B
Explanation: Anonymity is a key feature of the Delphi technique that contributes to its effectiveness by reducing bias and eliminating undue influence from any individual subject matter expert. This anonymity helps ensure that the collective wisdom is not skewed by the opinions or influence of a dominant individual.

Question: What is the process followed in the Delphi technique?
A: A detailed financial planning process for the project that ensures budgetary compliance
B: An iterative process of questionnaire distribution, feedback collection, and consensus-building among experts
C: A legal assessment process for the project that ensures compliance and risk mitigation measures
D: A technical evaluation process for the project that ensures the use of the latest technology
Answer: B
Explanation: The process followed in the Delphi technique involves initiating with a questionnaire to experts, collecting feedback anonymously, summarizing and redistributing the responses for further comments, and repeating these steps in multiple rounds until a consensus is reached. This iterative process is designed to build a collective agreement among experts.

Question: What kind of decisions can benefit from the application of the Delphi technique?
A: Financial investment decisions for the project
B: Decisions related to validating requirements, prioritizing features, or making estimations
C: Legal decision-making such as contract negotiations, compliance, and risk mitigation measures
D: Technical architecture decisions such as choosing the right technology stack
Answer: B
Explanation: The Delphi technique can be beneficially applied in decisions related to validating requirements, prioritizing features or user stories, and making more accurate estimations. These applications leverage the collective wisdom of subject matter experts to arrive at well-rounded and thoroughly considered decisions.

Question: Why is the Delphi technique considered effective in informed decision-making?
A: Because it provides a detailed financial overview of project components and tasks
B: Due to its ability to gather well-rounded input from multiple experts, leading to more reliable consensus-based decisions
C: Because it focuses on legal compliance, risk mitigation, and contract negotiations to ensure project success
D: Because it emphasizes technical details and ensures the use of the latest technology
Answer: B
Explanation: The Delphi technique is considered effective in informed decision-making because it gathers input from multiple subject matter experts. This collective input, refined through iterative rounds, leads to more reliable consensus-based decisions that are well-rounded and thoroughly considered.
