# Delphi

The Delphi technique is a consensus-building approach specifically designed to gather information and arrive at a collective agreement among a group of subject matter experts (SMEs). This technique is particularly beneficial in the validation of requirements, among other applications such as prioritization and estimation.

### Process Overview

1. **Initiation**: A facilitator initiates the process, usually by sending out a questionnaire to the SMEs. The questionnaire aims to elicit opinions, feedback, or insights about a particular subjectâ€”most commonly requirements validity in the context of business analysis.

2. **Anonymity**: One of the key features is the anonymous participation of experts, which serves to reduce bias and eliminates undue influence from any individual SME.

3. **Summary and Redistribution**: After the first round of responses, the facilitator summarizes the collected data and redistributes it to the SMEs for another round of comments.

4. **Iterative Rounds**: This step is repeated in multiple rounds until the feedback starts to converge towards a consensus. The number of rounds may vary based on the complexity of the subject and the level of initial disagreement among the experts.

5. **Consensus**: The aim is to reach a consensus. If a consensus is achieved, the results are then documented and used as agreed upon, whether that be for validating requirements, prioritizing features, or any other decision-making process.

### Key Benefits

- **Reduction of Bias**: The anonymity and iterative nature of the process work to reduce individual biases and undue influence, which might otherwise skew the results.

- **Data Integrity**: The iterative rounds and summarized feedback serve to refine and improve the quality of the collective wisdom, ultimately aimed at a more reliable consensus.

- **Informed Decision-making**: With input from multiple SMEs, decisions based on Delphi technique results are generally well-rounded and thoroughly considered.

### Key Applications

- **Validate Requirements**: In the requirements validation phase, SMEs can use the Delphi technique to collectively agree on the validity and sufficiency of the proposed requirements.

- **Estimation and Prioritization**: Delphi can also be employed for making more accurate estimations, and for prioritizing requirements, features, or user stories.

- **Design Options**: When multiple design solutions are possible, the Delphi technique can aid in choosing the most feasible or effective one.

In conclusion, the Delphi technique is a robust method for achieving a high-quality consensus within a group of experts, particularly useful in scenarios where bias and influence can be detrimental to the decision-making process.
