# Definition Of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) serves as a checklist of criteria that must be met before a user story or any work item is considered well-understood and ready for implementation. Unlike the Definition of Done, which confirms the completion of an item, the Definition of Ready ensures that a work item is adequately defined and prepared for the work to commence. Here are some essential aspects to understand:

## Components of Definition of Ready

- **Well-Defined Acceptance Criteria**: The user story must have clear and precise acceptance criteria, outlining the conditions that the solution must satisfy.

- **Dependencies Identified**: Any dependencies, whether internal or external, should be recognized and planned for.

- **Estimation Completed**: Effort estimates should be provided to ensure that the team understands the magnitude of the work involved.

- **Resource Availability**: All necessary resources, both human and material, should be available or planned for.

## When to Use Definition of Ready

- **Before Iteration**: DoR ensures that as a user story is introduced into an iteration, there's a clear understanding of what needs to be done, thereby reducing ambiguity during the development phase.

- **Prior to Design and Construction**: Before any design or construction activities are undertaken, the Definition of Ready ensures that the scope and requirements are well-understood.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

- **Complements Definition of Done**: While the Definition of Ready assures that a user story is sufficiently elaborated to begin work, the Definition of Done confirms that all criteria are met for the work to be considered complete.

## Implications for Business Analysis

- **Enhanced Clarity**: DoR helps in clearly defining the 'what' and the 'how' before diving into the actual work, thereby minimizing misunderstandings and rework.

- **Risk Mitigation**: By ensuring that all conditions are met before work begins, DoR serves as a risk mitigation tool, potentially avoiding bottlenecks and project delays.

- **Stakeholder Alignment**: It helps in ensuring that everyone, from developers to business stakeholders, is on the same page regarding what is to be delivered.

Adhering to a well-structured Definition of Ready ensures that a project team has a robust framework for initiating work items, reducing the scope for ambiguities, inefficiencies, and risks. It forms an essential part of agile methodologies but can also be applied in various other project management paradigms.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: A project team is about to start working on a new feature in their software application. Before beginning the development work, they want to ensure that the feature is well-understood and prepared for implementation. Which concept should they apply to determine if the feature is ready to be worked on?
A: Definition of Done (DoD)
B: Definition of Ready (DoR)
C: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
D: Risk Assessment Matrix
Answer: B
Explanation: The Definition of Ready (DoR) is a checklist of criteria that must be met before a user story or work item is considered ready for implementation, making it suitable to determine if a new feature is prepared for development.

Question: What is a key component of the Definition of Ready (DoR) in Agile project management?
A: Well-defined acceptance criteria for the user story
B: A finalized project budget and resource allocation
C: Allocation of office space for the team members
D: A detailed project timeline
Answer: A
Explanation: A key component of the Definition of Ready (DoR) is having well-defined acceptance criteria for the user story, which outlines the conditions that the solution must satisfy.

Question: How does the Definition of Ready (DoR) contribute to risk mitigation in a project?
A: By ensuring high returns on investment (ROI) for the project
B: By confirming all criteria are met before work begins
C: By assigning tasks to the most skilled team members
D: By creating a detailed marketing plan
Answer: B
Explanation: The Definition of Ready (DoR) contributes to risk mitigation by ensuring that all necessary conditions are met before work begins on a user story or work item, potentially avoiding bottlenecks and project delays.

Question: In which phase of a project is the Definition of Ready (DoR) particularly important?
A: After the project completion phase
B: Before starting design and construction activities
C: During the project closure phase after all work is completed
D: While preparing the final project report
Answer: B
Explanation: The Definition of Ready (DoR) is particularly important before starting design and construction activities, as it ensures that the scope and requirements are well-understood, thereby reducing ambiguity.

Question: What is the relationship between the Definition of Ready (DoR) and the Definition of Done (DoD)?
A: DoR confirms completion, while DoD ensures readiness
B: DoR ensures readiness, while DoD confirms completion
C: Both DoR and DoD focus on project budgeting and resource allocation
D: Both DoR and DoD deal with stakeholder communication
Answer: B
Explanation: The Definition of Ready (DoR) ensures that a user story or work item is sufficiently elaborated to begin work, while the Definition of Done (DoD) confirms that all criteria are met for the work to be considered complete.
