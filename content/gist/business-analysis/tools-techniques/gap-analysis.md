# Gap Analysis

Gap Analysis is a comparison technique used primarily to identify the difference between the current state ('as-is') and the desired future state ('to-be') of an organization or a specific business function. This technique is often employed during the Needs Assessment phase of a project.

### Current State Assessment

- The analysis starts by evaluating the current state of the organization, considering various elements like processes, systems, personnel, and other environmental factors.

- The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the organization or system currently operates.

### Future State Assessment

- Following the current state assessment, the future state is explored, focusing on the capabilities or features needed to address the identified business problem or seize an opportunity.

- This may include changes to processes, addition of new systems, organizational restructuring, or any other modifications that would be required to meet the objectives.

### Identifying the Gap

- The essence of gap analysis is in comparing these two states. Required capabilities for the future state are weighed against what exists in the current state.

- The "gap" is essentially the set of missing capabilities or features that need to be developed, acquired, or optimized to transition from the current state to the future state.

### Importance and Use Cases

- Gap Analysis is a crucial tool for business analysts as it helps in the identification of what needs to be done to move from one state to another.

- It forms the basis for defining the scope of work, setting project objectives, and planning out the steps needed for implementation.

### Further Application

- Gap analysis is not limited to just organizational assessment; it can be applied to software, business processes, and various other operational areas.

- The results of a gap analysis are often presented in a Gap Analysis Report, which details the findings and suggests actionable steps to bridge the gap.

By providing a clear depiction of where an organization stands and where it needs to go, Gap Analysis serves as an invaluable tool for decision-makers to allocate resources effectively, prioritize tasks, and create a strategic plan to achieve business objectives.
