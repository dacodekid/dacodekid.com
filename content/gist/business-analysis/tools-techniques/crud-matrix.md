# CRUD Matrix

A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Matrix is an analytical tool used to identify the interactions between different entities (like data objects) and system functionalities. It helps to recognize where each function performs one of the CRUD operations on a particular entity. This can be essential for understanding system behavior and for specifying requirements for a system.

Here's a sample CRUD Matrix with some example data:

| Functionality / Data Object | Customer | Product | Order |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----- |
| Add Customer                | C        |         |       |
| View Customer               | R        |         |       |
| Update Customer             | U        |         |       |
| Delete Customer             | D        |         |       |
| List Products               |          | R       |       |
| Add Product                 |          | C       |       |
| Update Product              |          | U       |       |
| Remove Product              |          | D       |       |
| Create Order                |          |         | C     |
| View Order                  | R        | R       | R     |
| Update Order                |          |         | U     |
| Cancel Order                |          |         | D     |

In this matrix:

- Columns represent data objects like "Customer," "Product," and "Order."
- Rows signify different functionalities such as "Add Customer," "View Customer," etc.

The letters (C, R, U, D) indicate which type of operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) each functionality performs on each data object.

For example, the "Add Customer" functionality Creates a "Customer" (hence the 'C' under the "Customer" column). The "View Order" functionality Reads from "Customer," "Product," and "Order" (indicated by 'R's in the respective columns).

This is a simple example, but CRUD Matrices can get much more complex based on the complexity and scope of the system.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: A business analyst is designing a new inventory management system and needs to define how different functionalities interact with various data entities. Which tool would be most effective for this purpose?
A: SWOT Analysis
B: Gantt Chart
C: CRUD Matrix
D: Fishbone Diagram
Answer: C
Explanation: A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Matrix is an analytical tool used to identify interactions between different functionalities and data entities in a system, making it suitable for defining these interactions in an inventory management system.

Question: In a CRUD Matrix, what does the letter 'C' typically represent when placed under a data object column next to a functionality?
A: The functionality Completes a task with the data object
B: The functionality Creates a new instance of the data object
C: The functionality Checks the data object
D: The functionality Connects to another data object
Answer: B
Explanation: In a CRUD Matrix, the letter 'C' stands for 'Create' and represents that the functionality creates a new instance of the data object.

Question: If a functionality is marked with a 'D' in the 'Order' column of a CRUD Matrix, what does it signify about the system's capability?
A: It displays details of an Order
B: It duplicates the Order information
C: It deletes an Order
D: It downloads Order data
Answer: C
Explanation: A 'D' in the 'Order' column of a CRUD Matrix indicates that the functionality has the capability to delete an Order in the system.

Question: When analyzing a CRUD Matrix, what does the presence of multiple 'R's in a row across different data objects suggest about a functionality?
A: The functionality requires a high level of technical expertise
B: The functionality reads from multiple data objects
C: The functionality is resource-intensive
D: The functionality is redundant and can be optimized
Answer: B
Explanation: Multiple 'R's in a row across different data objects in a CRUD Matrix suggest that the functionality reads or retrieves data from multiple data objects.

Question: In the context of system requirement specification, how is a CRUD Matrix particularly helpful?
A: It provides a timeline for project completion
B: It outlines the project's budget allocations
C: It helps to specify requirements based on data-object interactions
D: It assigns roles and responsibilities to team members
Answer: C
Explanation: A CRUD Matrix is particularly helpful in system requirement specification as it identifies the interactions between different functionalities and data objects, aiding in the specification of system requirements.
