# Speedboat

The Speedboat game is a collaborative elicitation technique used to identify obstacles and challenges that are impeding progress or affecting performance. In this visual and interactive exercise, the "speedboat" represents a project, product, or process that stakeholders and team members wish to improve. The "anchors" represent the issues or problems that are holding it back from reaching its full potential.

## Key Components

- **Visual Board**: Typically a whiteboard or flipchart depicting a speedboat and multiple anchors.
- **Facilitator**: Someone to guide the session, clarify rules, and ensure objectives are met.

- **Participants**: Team members, stakeholders, and others who are interested or impacted by the area under discussion.

- **Markers, Sticky Notes**: Used by participants to write down and visually place their anchors on the board.

- **Timebox**: The session is usually time-constrained to ensure focus.

## How It Works

1. **Introduction and Context**: The facilitator sets the stage by explaining the metaphor of the speedboat and anchors. The goal of identifying what is holding the "boat" back is clarified.

2. **Identify Anchors**: Participants are given a set amount of time to write down the issues, problems, or challenges they perceive as anchors on sticky notes.

3. **Place Anchors**: Participants come up and place their sticky notes on the board, each representing an anchor tied to the speedboat.

4. **Discussion**: Participants explain their anchors, and a facilitator-led discussion follows to explore each anchor in depth. Similar anchors can be grouped together.

5. **Prioritize and Analyze**: The team collaboratively prioritizes the anchors based on impact, urgency, or other relevant criteria.

6. **Action Planning**: Based on the discussion and prioritization, action items or recommendations are formulated for removing or mitigating the anchors.

## Advantages

- **Problem Identification**: Provides a structured way to identify and articulate issues or challenges.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Ensures active involvement of stakeholders by allowing them to physically place and discuss their anchors.

- **Collective Insight**: Enables teams to benefit from diverse viewpoints and facilitates consensus-building.

- **Focus on Improvement**: Drives the team to think about solutions and action plans for the issues identified.

The Speedboat technique is often used in Agile environments but is versatile enough to be useful in any framework or methodology. It is particularly effective for retrospective meetings, problem-solving sessions, or any situation where impediments need to be identified and addressed.

## Quiz

Question: A project team is encountering several challenges and roadblocks in their current workflow. The project manager decides to organize an interactive session to identify and address these issues. Which elicitation technique would be most appropriate for this scenario?
A: SWOT Analysis
B: Speedboat Game
C: User Story Mapping
D: Delphi Technique
Answer: B
Explanation: The Speedboat game is a collaborative elicitation technique used specifically to identify obstacles and challenges impeding progress. It involves stakeholders and team members identifying "anchors" that are holding back the project, making it ideal for this scenario.

Question: In the Speedboat game, what does the "speedboat" metaphorically represent?
A: The competitors in the market that are affecting the project
B: The project, product, or process under discussion
C: The team's goals and aspirations including the vision statement
D: The budget allocated for the project
Answer: B
Explanation: In the Speedboat game, the "speedboat" represents the project, product, or process that stakeholders and team members wish to improve. It's a metaphor for the subject under discussion.

Question: During a Speedboat session, participants are using sticky notes to write down various issues. What is the primary purpose of these sticky notes in the context of the exercise?
A: To document action items for future reference and follow-up
B: To represent problems or challenges as "anchors"
C: To vote on the most important topics for discussion
D: To schedule follow-up meetings
Answer: B
Explanation: In the Speedboat exercise, sticky notes are used by participants to write down and visually represent issues or challenges as "anchors." These anchors symbolize the problems holding back the "speedboat."

Question: What is the primary advantage of employing the Speedboat technique in a project retrospective meeting?
A: Cost-Benefit Analysis
B: Resource Allocation
C: Problem Identification
D: Performance Evaluation
Answer: C
Explanation: The primary advantage of the Speedboat technique, especially in a retrospective meeting, is Problem Identification. It provides a structured way to identify and articulate issues or challenges affecting the project.

Question: After the anchors have been identified and discussed in a Speedboat session, what is the next crucial step?
A: Immediate Implementation of Solutions
B: Action Planning
C: Scheduling another meeting
D: Dismissing less critical anchors
Answer: B
Explanation: After identifying and discussing the anchors in a Speedboat session, the next crucial step is Action Planning. This involves formulating action items or recommendations for removing or mitigating the identified anchors.
