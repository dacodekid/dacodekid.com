# Fishbone/Ishikawa Diagram

Fishbone diagrams, also known as Ishikawa diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams, are graphical tools for root cause analysis. The objective of using a fishbone diagram is to identify potential causes of a problem or effect and categorize them in a structured manner. This assists teams in understanding the origins of a problem, facilitating a comprehensive analysis before moving towards solution implementation. This technique aligns well with the concept of Requirements Life Cycle Management in business analysis, where understanding the problem deeply can lead to effective requirements elicitation and management.

## Key Components of Fishbone Diagrams

- **Head (Effect/Problem)**: The specific problem or effect under analysis is stated at the "head" of the fishbone diagram. It is often framed as a question.
- **Spine (Central Axis)**: A horizontal line that extends from the head and serves as the backbone of the fish. This line is where the primary "bones" or categories of causes are attached.

- **Bones (Causes and Categories)**: Major categories of causes or factors that contribute to the problem. These "bones" branch off from the spine. Each category may further have sub-categories or "sub-bones," which are the sub-causes contributing to the primary cause.

- **Sub-Causes**: These are finer-level causes that stem from the primary causes. They are also branching off as smaller "bones" from the primary bones on the diagram.

## Process for Creating Fishbone Diagrams

1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly articulate the problem or effect that you want to analyze and place it at the head of the fish.

2. **Identify Categories**: Use standard categories such as machines, methods, materials, measurements, people, policies, processes, and places, or customize based on the specific context.

3. **Identify Causes**: For each category, brainstorm possible causes contributing to the problem. Place these along the "bones" of the diagram.

4. **Identify Sub-Causes**: Dig deeper into each primary cause by asking “why” it happens, and identify sub-causes. Continue this process to create multiple layers of sub-causes as needed.

5. **Analyze and Prioritize**: Look for patterns among the causes. Mark or circle those that seem to be more significant or recurring, as these may be the root causes requiring focused attention.

## Limitations and Considerations

While fishbone diagrams are powerful for initial root cause analysis and facilitate a structured brainstorming process, they are not exhaustive. They serve as a starting point and may need to be complemented by other techniques like Five Whys, surveys, or data analytics for a comprehensive analysis.

Overall, the use of fishbone diagrams enhances the quality of requirements and solutions by ensuring that teams do not jump to conclusions but rather engage in a thorough analysis to understand the underlying issues contributing to a problem.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary objective of using a Fishbone/Ishikawa Diagram in root cause analysis?
A: To manage team schedules and project timelines.
B: Identifying potential causes of a problem and categorizing them.
C: Focusing on the development of new marketing strategies and campaigns.
D: Tracking financial transactions and budget allocations for the project.
Answer: B
Explanation: The primary objective of using a Fishbone/Ishikawa Diagram is to identify potential causes of a problem or effect and categorize them in a structured manner.

Question: In the creation of a Fishbone Diagram, what role does the 'Spine' play?
A: It represents the timeline for project completion.
B: The Spine serves as the central axis where primary causes are attached.
C: Used for outlining the financial budget of the project and its allocation.
D: It displays the hierarchy of the project team.
Answer: B
Explanation: In a Fishbone Diagram, the Spine serves as the central axis, extending from the head, where the primary categories of causes or "bones" are attached.

Question: How does a Fishbone Diagram assist in Requirements Life Cycle Management?
A: By scheduling regular team meetings and discussions.
B: Facilitating deep understanding of a problem for effective requirements elicitation.
C: Focusing exclusively on customer relationship management.
D: Tracking the sales performance of products.
Answer: B
Explanation: Fishbone Diagrams align well with Requirements Life Cycle Management by facilitating a deep understanding of a problem, which leads to effective requirements elicitation and management.

Question: What is a key step in the process of creating Fishbone Diagrams?
A: Assigning project tasks to team members and stakeholders.
B: Brainstorming possible causes for each identified category.
C: Developing advertising and promotional materials for the project.
D: Calculating return on investment for projects.
Answer: B
Explanation: A key step in creating Fishbone Diagrams is brainstorming possible causes for each identified category and placing these causes along the "bones" of the diagram.

Question: What limitation should be considered when using Fishbone Diagrams?
A: They are only useful for large-scale international projects and not for smaller projects.
B: They are not exhaustive and may need to be complemented by other techniques.
C: Suitable exclusively for IT and software development projects and solutions.
D: Can only be used for employee performance evaluation.
Answer: B
Explanation: While Fishbone Diagrams are powerful for initial root cause analysis, they are not exhaustive and may need to be complemented by other techniques like Five Whys, surveys, or data analytics for a comprehensive analysis.
