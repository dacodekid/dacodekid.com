# Wide-Band Delphi

Wide-Band Delphi is a variation of the classical Delphi technique, adapted to include more extensive communication and collaboration among the participants. It aims to reach a more accurate and agreed-upon estimate by reconciling widely varying initial estimates through iterative rounds of estimation and discussion.

## Core Steps in Wide-Band Delphi

1. **Initial Anonymous Estimates**: Similar to the traditional Delphi technique, experts individually and anonymously provide their initial estimates for the task or product backlog item.

2. **Compilation of Estimates**: All the estimates are compiled and summarized, often showing the range, median, and mode of the estimates.

3. **Group Discussion**: Unlike traditional Delphi, where feedback is mainly written and participants remain anonymous, Wide-Band Delphi allows for direct discussion among experts. This can happen in a face-to-face meeting, virtual conference, or other collaborative forums.

4. **Rationale Sharing**: Those who provided the highest and lowest estimates are given an opportunity to share their reasoning. This helps in uncovering hidden assumptions, overlooked risks, or additional context that may affect the estimate.

5. **Re-Estimation**: Experts revise their estimates based on the discussion and any new insights gained.

6. **Iteration**: The process of summarization, discussion, and re-estimation is repeated until a convergence of estimates is achieved.

## Advantages

- **Improved Accuracy**: The increased bandwidth of communication allows for better understanding and therefore more accurate estimates.

- **Enhanced Team Collaboration**: Open discussions enable team members to share insights, reducing the likelihood of overlooking key factors.

- **Quick Convergence**: The iterative approach, coupled with open discussions, usually leads to quicker convergence compared to traditional Delphi.

## Disadvantages

- **Time-Consuming**: Because it involves more discussion, it can be more time-consuming compared to traditional Delphi.

- **Potential for Bias**: The anonymity is compromised to some extent, which may introduce bias or influence from dominant personalities.

## Applicability

- **Complex Projects**: Useful for tasks that are complex and where initial estimates can vary widely.

- **Expert-Led Environments**: Best suited for situations where a variety of experts contribute to the project and their collective wisdom is valued.

- **Agile Methodologies**: It can be effectively integrated into Agile frameworks where iterative estimation and re-estimation are common.

Wide-Band Delphi combines the structured, anonymous input of the Delphi technique with more open communication to arrive at reliable estimates. Whether applied formally or informally, it offers a balanced approach to harness collective expertise while allowing for discussion and clarification.

Question: What distinguishes Wide-Band Delphi from the traditional Delphi technique?
A: Wide-Band Delphi involves direct discussion among experts, while traditional Delphi mainly uses written, anonymous feedback.
B: Wide-Band Delphi focuses on financial estimates only.
C: Traditional Delphi involves more direct communication, whereas Wide-Band Delphi does not.
D: Traditional Delphi is used exclusively in legal contexts, unlike Wide-Band Delphi.
Answer: A
Explanation: The main distinction between Wide-Band Delphi and traditional Delphi is the form of communication. Wide-Band Delphi allows for direct discussion among experts, which can be in face-to-face meetings or virtual conferences, whereas traditional Delphi typically involves anonymous, written feedback without direct communication.

Question: What is a key advantage of using Wide-Band Delphi in estimation processes?
A: It ensures financial accuracy in estimates.
B: It improves accuracy and enhances team collaboration through open discussions.
C: It focuses solely on the legal aspects of estimation.
D: It emphasizes the technical precision of estimates.
Answer: B
Explanation: A key advantage of using Wide-Band Delphi is that it improves the accuracy of estimates through increased bandwidth of communication. The open discussions among team members enhance team collaboration, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the task at hand and reducing the likelihood of overlooking key factors.

Question: How does Wide-Band Delphi achieve convergence in estimates?
A: By focusing on the financial aspects of estimates
B: Through an iterative process of summarization, discussion, and re-estimation
C: By using legal benchmarks for estimation
D: By emphasizing technical details in estimation
Answer: B
Explanation: Wide-Band Delphi achieves convergence in estimates through an iterative process that involves summarizing the initial estimates, followed by group discussions and sharing of rationale. This process is repeated with re-estimation until the estimates converge, ensuring a collective agreement among experts.

Question: What is a potential disadvantage of Wide-Band Delphi compared to traditional Delphi?
A: It can be more time-consuming due to the inclusion of direct discussions.
B: It provides less accurate financial estimates.
C: It compromises the legal integrity of the estimation process.
D: It does not consider technical aspects of the task.
Answer: A
Explanation: A potential disadvantage of Wide-Band Delphi compared to traditional Delphi is that it can be more time-consuming. This is because Wide-Band Delphi includes direct discussions among experts, which, while beneficial for understanding and accuracy, require additional time to conduct.

Question: In what scenario is Wide-Band Delphi particularly useful?
A: In projects where financial estimation is the only concern
B: In complex projects where initial estimates can vary widely and collective expert wisdom is valued
C: In scenarios where legal assessments are crucial
D: In situations focusing exclusively on technical evaluations
Answer: B
Explanation: Wide-Band Delphi is particularly useful in complex projects where initial estimates can vary widely. It is best suited for environments where a variety of experts contribute to the project, and their collective wisdom and insights are crucial for arriving at accurate and agreed-upon estimates.
