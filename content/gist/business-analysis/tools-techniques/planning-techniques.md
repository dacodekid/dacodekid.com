# Planning Techniques

Planning techniques are crucial in managing projects effectively, especially in adapting to different project life cycles. Let's explore some typical planning techniques, each with its unique application and context.

## [Product Backlog](./product-backlog.md)

### Overview

The product backlog is a prioritized list of items (like user stories, requirements, or features) that need to be delivered for a solution.

### Application in Planning

- **Prioritization:** Items are estimated and selected in a prioritized order for upcoming iterations.
- **Readiness:** The focus is on ensuring each item meets the 'definition of ready' before development starts.
- **Backlog Refinement:** Ongoing effort to refine and update the backlog, including looking ahead to future iterations.

## [Rolling Wave Planning](./rolling-wave-planning.md)

### Overview

Rolling wave planning is an iterative technique where near-term work is planned in detail, while future work is planned at a higher level.

### Application

- **Predictive Life Cycle:** Used for detailed planning of business analysis tasks at specific intervals.
- **Adaptive Life Cycle:** Helps in release-level planning by determining features and functions for current or upcoming releases.
- **Progressive Elaboration:** Incorporates new information into plans as the project progresses.

## [Story Mapping](./story-mapping.md)

### Overview

Story mapping is used in adaptive life cycle projects to sequence user stories based on business value and user activity sequence.

### Role in Planning

- **Visualization:** Provides a shared understanding of what will be built.
- **Analysis Timing:** Helps in identifying when more effort is needed for analysis.
- **Sequencing:** Orders user stories to align with business priorities and user experience.

## [Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)](./work-breakdown-structure-wbs.md)

### Overview

The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work for projects in a predictive life cycle.

### Function

- **Scope Breakdown:** Divides the project scope into manageable components or deliverables.
- **Scheduling Basis:** Forms the foundation for creating a project schedule, considering estimates, priorities, dependencies, and constraints.
- **Revision and Updating:** Regularly revised, often at phase gates, to reflect project progression.

## Conclusion

Each of these planning techniques offers a structured approach to managing different aspects of a project. The choice of technique depends on the project's life cycle (adaptive or predictive), the nature of the tasks, and the goals of the project. Using these methods effectively can lead to more efficient and successful project outcomes, ensuring that all tasks are appropriately planned, prioritized, and executed.
