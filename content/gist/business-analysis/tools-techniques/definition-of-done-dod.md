# Definition Of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done (DoD) serves as a set of mutually agreed-upon conditions that a team commits to meet before a work item is considered complete and ready for acceptance by business stakeholders. Establishing a clear DoD is pivotal for understanding when a task, such as a user story or iteration, is truly completed, thereby allowing the team to transition to subsequent tasks. Here is a detailed exploration of its components, levels, and implications:

## Components of Definition of Done

- **Acceptance Criteria**: The fundamental benchmarks that need to be satisfied for a work item to be considered complete. They serve as explicit conditions that must be met.

- **Conformance Standards**: This includes adherence to defined development, testing, and defect standards. It ensures that the quality benchmarks are met and maintained.

- **Non-Functional and Usability Requirements**: Requirements concerning the systemâ€™s operation, performance, and usability also often form part of the DoD.

## Levels at Which DoD Can Be Defined

- **User Story Level**: For each user story, a DoD ensures that all acceptance criteria are fulfilled, and other conditions are met before it can be considered complete.

- **Iteration Level**: For Sprints or other iterations, a DoD outlines what needs to be completed for the entire iteration to be considered done.

- **Release Level**: At this stage, the DoD ensures that the release as a whole meets the predefined conditions and is ready for production.

- **Product Level**: Here, the DoD is often more strategic, focusing on higher-level business and operational requirements that the product must meet.

## Flexibility and Evolution

- **Uniformity and Specificity**: While the DoD is generally uniform across a product or a portfolio, specific user stories or tasks may have tailored definitions depending on their unique requirements.

- **Evolution Over Time**: The DoD is not set in stone and can evolve as the team gains more insights or the project scope changes.

## Implications for Business Analysis

- **Early Definition**: DoDs are established early in the lifecycle of a portfolio, program, or project. Early definition ensures alignment with business objectives and stakeholder expectations.

- **Input for Solution Evaluation**: The DoD, especially when integrated with acceptance criteria, becomes a crucial input when evaluating the readiness of a solution for release.

- **Tracking and Monitoring**: Once an item meets the DoD criteria, it is marked as such in planning and management tools, such as project plans, requirements management tools, or Kanban boards.

Understanding and implementing a robust Definition of Done is essential for project success as it provides a clear roadmap for what needs to be achieved, thereby minimizing ambiguities and enhancing productivity.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: A project team is working on a new software feature and wants to ensure that all aspects of the work are completed to a standard acceptable to the business stakeholders. Which concept should they establish to determine when the feature is ready for acceptance?
A: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
B: Definition of Done (DoD)
C: Project Charter
D: Risk Management Plan
Answer: B
Explanation: The Definition of Done (DoD) is a set of mutually agreed-upon conditions that a team commits to meet before a work item is considered complete and ready for acceptance by business stakeholders, making it the appropriate concept to determine when a feature is ready.

Question: In the context of Agile project management, what does the Definition of Done (DoD) typically include at the User Story level?
A: A list of all project stakeholders
B: A detailed project timeline
C: Acceptance criteria and other conditions for each user story
D: The total budget for the user story
Answer: C
Explanation: At the User Story level, the Definition of Done (DoD) typically includes acceptance criteria and other conditions that need to be fulfilled for the user story to be considered complete.

Question: How can the Definition of Done (DoD) evolve throughout the lifecycle of a project?
A: It remains constant and does not change
B: It evolves as the team gains insights or the project scope changes
C: It becomes less detailed and more general
D: It is only defined at the beginning and end of the project
Answer: B
Explanation: The Definition of Done (DoD) is not static and can evolve over time as the team gains more insights or as the project scope changes, ensuring continued alignment with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.

Question: What role does the Definition of Done (DoD) play in the solution evaluation phase of a project?
A: It provides a baseline for the project budget
B: It becomes a crucial input when evaluating the readiness of a solution for release
C: It outlines the roles and responsibilities of project team members
D: It schedules the tasks necessary for solution implementation
Answer: B
Explanation: The Definition of Done (DoD), particularly when integrated with acceptance criteria, serves as a crucial input in the solution evaluation phase, helping to determine the readiness of a solution for release.

Question: When a project item meets the criteria established in the Definition of Done (DoD), how is this typically reflected in project management tools?
A: The item is marked as 'in progress'
B: The item is marked as 'done' or 'complete'
C: The item's budget allocation is increased
D: The item's deadline is extended
Answer: B
Explanation: Once a project item meets the Definition of Done (DoD) criteria, it is typically marked as 'done' or 'complete' in project management tools, such as project plans, requirements management tools, or Kanban boards.
