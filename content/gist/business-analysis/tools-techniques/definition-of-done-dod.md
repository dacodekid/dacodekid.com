# Definition Of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done (DoD) serves as a set of mutually agreed-upon conditions that a team commits to meet before a work item is considered complete and ready for acceptance by business stakeholders. Establishing a clear DoD is pivotal for understanding when a task, such as a user story or iteration, is truly completed, thereby allowing the team to transition to subsequent tasks. Here is a detailed exploration of its components, levels, and implications:

### Components of Definition of Done

- **Acceptance Criteria**: The fundamental benchmarks that need to be satisfied for a work item to be considered complete. They serve as explicit conditions that must be met.

- **Conformance Standards**: This includes adherence to defined development, testing, and defect standards. It ensures that the quality benchmarks are met and maintained.

- **Non-Functional and Usability Requirements**: Requirements concerning the systemâ€™s operation, performance, and usability also often form part of the DoD.

### Levels at Which DoD Can Be Defined

- **User Story Level**: For each user story, a DoD ensures that all acceptance criteria are fulfilled, and other conditions are met before it can be considered complete.

- **Iteration Level**: For Sprints or other iterations, a DoD outlines what needs to be completed for the entire iteration to be considered done.

- **Release Level**: At this stage, the DoD ensures that the release as a whole meets the predefined conditions and is ready for production.

- **Product Level**: Here, the DoD is often more strategic, focusing on higher-level business and operational requirements that the product must meet.

### Flexibility and Evolution

- **Uniformity and Specificity**: While the DoD is generally uniform across a product or a portfolio, specific user stories or tasks may have tailored definitions depending on their unique requirements.

- **Evolution Over Time**: The DoD is not set in stone and can evolve as the team gains more insights or the project scope changes.

### Implications for Business Analysis

- **Early Definition**: DoDs are established early in the lifecycle of a portfolio, program, or project. Early definition ensures alignment with business objectives and stakeholder expectations.

- **Input for Solution Evaluation**: The DoD, especially when integrated with acceptance criteria, becomes a crucial input when evaluating the readiness of a solution for release.

- **Tracking and Monitoring**: Once an item meets the DoD criteria, it is marked as such in planning and management tools, such as project plans, requirements management tools, or Kanban boards.

Understanding and implementing a robust Definition of Done is essential for project success as it provides a clear roadmap for what needs to be achieved, thereby minimizing ambiguities and enhancing productivity.
