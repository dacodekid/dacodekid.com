# Interaction Matrix

An Interaction Matrix serves as a snapshot tool for analyzing the relationships between different types of product information at a specific point in time. Unlike a traceability matrix, which is a living document that evolves over the course of a project, an interaction matrix is not maintained over time. It is utilized to evaluate whether requirements are adequately detailed and to identify any missing entities.

In the structure of the Interaction Matrix:

- Rows represent one category of product information, such as use cases, user stories, or process flows.
- Columns represent another category of product information, like data entities, business rules, or user interfaces.

To populate the matrix, an "X" is placed at the intersection where the product information in a row uses or references the product information in a corresponding column. This enables quick visualization of the relationships and dependencies between different elements.

### Example

| REQID   | Requirement     | Entity A | Entity B | Entity C | Entity D | Entity E | Column 1 |
| ------- | --------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| REQ-001 | Login User      | X        |          |          | X        |          | Data     |
| REQ-002 | Create Account  |          | X        | X        |          |          | Data     |
| REQ-003 | Update Profile  |          |          | X        |          | X        | Data     |
| REQ-004 | Delete Account  | X        |          |          |          |          | Data     |
| REQ-005 | Search Products |          | X        |          | X        | X        | Data     |

In this sample interaction matrix:

- REQID is the unique identifier for each requirement.
- "Requirement" describes the functional or non-functional requirement.
- Entities A, B, C, D, and E represent different types of product information, such as data entities, business rules, or user interfaces.
- An 'X' is placed in the matrix where the requirement (row) uses the entity (column).
- "Column 1" could be used for additional information or notes.

This interaction matrix is useful for evaluating the relationships between different requirements and entities at a specific point in time. The matrix helps in identifying gaps, overlaps, or areas where further clarification may be needed.
