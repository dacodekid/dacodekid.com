# Interaction Matrix

An Interaction Matrix serves as a snapshot tool for analyzing the relationships between different types of product information at a specific point in time. Unlike a traceability matrix, which is a living document that evolves over the course of a project, an interaction matrix is not maintained over time. It is utilized to evaluate whether requirements are adequately detailed and to identify any missing entities.

In the structure of the Interaction Matrix:

- Rows represent one category of product information, such as use cases, user stories, or process flows.
- Columns represent another category of product information, like data entities, business rules, or user interfaces.

To populate the matrix, an "X" is placed at the intersection where the product information in a row uses or references the product information in a corresponding column. This enables quick visualization of the relationships and dependencies between different elements.

## Example

| REQID   | Requirement     | Entity A | Entity B | Entity C | Entity D | Entity E | Column 1 |
| ------- | --------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| REQ-001 | Login User      | X        |          |          | X        |          | Data     |
| REQ-002 | Create Account  |          | X        | X        |          |          | Data     |
| REQ-003 | Update Profile  |          |          | X        |          | X        | Data     |
| REQ-004 | Delete Account  | X        |          |          |          |          | Data     |
| REQ-005 | Search Products |          | X        |          | X        | X        | Data     |

In this sample interaction matrix:

- REQID is the unique identifier for each requirement.
- "Requirement" describes the functional or non-functional requirement.
- Entities A, B, C, D, and E represent different types of product information, such as data entities, business rules, or user interfaces.
- An 'X' is placed in the matrix where the requirement (row) uses the entity (column).
- "Column 1" could be used for additional information or notes.

This interaction matrix is useful for evaluating the relationships between different requirements and entities at a specific point in time. The matrix helps in identifying gaps, overlaps, or areas where further clarification may be needed.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: A business analyst needs to analyze how different requirements in a project relate to various data entities at a specific point in time. Which tool would be most suitable for visualizing these relationships and dependencies?
A: Gantt Chart
B: Interaction Matrix
C: Risk Register
D: SWOT Analysis
Answer: B
Explanation: An Interaction Matrix is a tool used for analyzing relationships between different types of product information, such as requirements and data entities, at a specific point in time. It is suitable for visualizing these relationships and dependencies in a project.

Question: In an Interaction Matrix, how is the relationship between a requirement and a data entity typically indicated?
A: By assigning a numerical value
B: By placing an 'X' at their intersection
C: By coloring the cell
D: By writing a detailed description
Answer: B
Explanation: In an Interaction Matrix, the relationship between a requirement and a data entity is typically indicated by placing an 'X' at the intersection of the corresponding row and column.

Question: What is the primary purpose of using an Interaction Matrix in business analysis?
A: To schedule project activities
B: To allocate budget for different requirements
C: To evaluate whether requirements are adequately detailed and identify missing entities
D: To assign roles and responsibilities for requirements
Answer: C
Explanation: The primary purpose of using an Interaction Matrix in business analysis is to evaluate whether requirements are adequately detailed and to identify any missing entities. It helps in understanding the coverage and completeness of the requirements.

Question: How does an Interaction Matrix differ from a Traceability Matrix in terms of maintenance?
A: An Interaction Matrix is maintained and updated throughout the project lifecycle
B: An Interaction Matrix is a snapshot tool and is not maintained over time
C: A Traceability Matrix is not used for tracking changes
D: A Traceability Matrix is a one-time analysis tool
Answer: B
Explanation: Unlike a Traceability Matrix, which is a living document maintained over the course of a project, an Interaction Matrix is a snapshot tool used for analyzing relationships at a specific point in time and is not maintained over time.

Question: What type of information is typically represented in the rows and columns of an Interaction Matrix?
A: Rows represent project timelines, and columns represent team members
B: Rows represent one category of product information, and columns represent another category
C: Rows represent financial data, and columns represent budget categories
D: Rows represent team members, and columns represent their tasks
Answer: B
Explanation: In an Interaction Matrix, rows represent one category of product information (like use cases, user stories, or process flows), and columns represent another category of product information (like data entities, business rules, or user interfaces).
