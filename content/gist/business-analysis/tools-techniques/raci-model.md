# RACI Model

The RACI model serves as a comprehensive responsibility assignment matrix employed in portfolio, program, and project management, as well as business analysis. It is designed to delineate roles and responsibilities clearly and to mitigate confusion or conflict amongst stakeholders. It stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consult, and Inform, and these classifications are instrumental in outlining the type and level of engagement stakeholders have in activities, particularly those relating to business analysis.

### Importance in Business Analysis

In the context of business analysis, a RACI model aids in communicating who should be doing what throughout the business analysis effort. It becomes pivotal in scenarios where stakeholders may be engaged in multiple projects with varying roles or where there is ambiguity about who does what. It helps in focusing the stakeholders on their tasks and ensures that roles do not overlap in a manner that could create conflicts.

### Aligning with Stakeholder Analysis

The stakeholder analysis, which involves categorizing stakeholders based on attributes like power, influence, impact, or interest, often precedes the creation of a RACI model. These categories can guide the business analyst in determining the appropriate level of involvement for each stakeholder within the RACI framework. Stakeholder engagement levels, such as "unaware," "resistant," "neutral," "supportive," and "leading," further assist in developing a stakeholder engagement approach that aligns with the responsibilities defined in the RACI model.

### Components of RACI

The four principal classifications within the RACI model are:

- **R (Responsible)**: The individual or role tasked with the actual execution of an activity. They are the doers.
- **A (Accountable)**: The individual or role who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the task. This role typically has the authority to approve or reject the work.
- **C (Consult)**: Individuals or roles whose expertise or input is required to accomplish a task. They offer necessary guidance or information.
- **I (Inform)**: Individuals or roles who need to be kept updated on the progress or results of an activity. While they may not be directly involved in the task, the outcomes could impact them.

### Applications Across Lifecycle

It’s important to note that a stakeholder’s classification in the RACI model can change at different points in a product or project lifecycle or within different business analysis processes. The model serves as a dynamic tool that provides clarity and can be updated as necessary.

### Accountability Highlight

One of the unique features of the RACI model is its ability to highlight single points of accountability and instances where joint accountability may exist. This ensures that there's always someone answerable for every task, making the process transparent and manageable.

### Communication Strategy

Results from a RACI model inform communication plans and engagement strategies, ensuring that the right people are consulted, informed, and held accountable at the right times. This aligns with business analysis practices by ensuring effective stakeholder engagement throughout the project.

The RACI model is a robust tool that aids in the meticulous detailing of stakeholder roles and responsibilities, minimizing confusion, and enabling effective stakeholder engagement, which is integral to successful business analysis.

### Example

| Task \ Role | Role 1 | Role 2 | Role 3 | Role 4 |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Task 1      | R      | A      | C      | I      |
| Task 2      | A      | R      | I      | C      |
| Task 3      | C      | I      | A      | R      |
| Task 4      | I      | C      | R      | A      |
