# Estimation Poker

Estimation Poker is a consensus-based technique used for estimating tasks and backlog items in project management and Agile development frameworks. This method is a type of collaborative relative estimation that typically involves multiple team members. It operates on the premise that collective wisdom results in more accurate estimates.

## The Process

1. **Scale Agreement**: Before starting, the team agrees on a scale for estimation. The Fibonacci series is a commonly used scale (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...), but other modified scales can also be used, like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100.

2. **Card Distribution**: Each team member receives a set of cards that correspond to the agreed-upon scale.

3. **Reference Estimation**: The team often begins by selecting a reference item for estimation. This can be achieved using other consensus-building techniques such as Delphi or Wide-band Delphi.

4. **Estimation Round**: Each team member picks a card that, in their opinion, best represents the relative effort needed to complete the backlog item under consideration. Cards are revealed simultaneously to prevent bias.

5. **Discussion**: Members who provided the highest and lowest estimates explain their rationale. This initiates a discussion aimed at reconciling the different perspectives.

6. **Re-Estimation**: Following the discussion, a new round of estimation occurs. The process is repeated until a consensus is reached.

7. **Convergence**: The end goal is to reach an estimate that everyone agrees upon.

## Benefits

- **Collaborative Insight**: By involving multiple perspectives, Estimation Poker taps into the collective wisdom of the team, usually leading to more accurate estimates.

- **Bias Minimization**: The simultaneous reveal of cards prevents team members from being influenced by others, thus reducing estimation bias.

- **Quick Convergence**: The iterative nature, combined with discussion and clarification, usually results in quick convergence on an acceptable estimate.

- **Contextual Understanding**: The discussion process educates team members on different aspects of the task, providing a more well-rounded understanding of what is involved.

## Applications

- Primarily used in Agile frameworks, like Scrum, for estimating the effort required for user stories or product backlog items.

- Can be used in conjunction with other techniques like the Delphi method for initial reference estimation.

- Applicable in both software development projects and other types of project management scenarios where tasks need to be estimated.

In summary, Estimation Poker is an effective, collaborative technique for relative estimation that combines individual judgment with team consensus, optimized for quick and accurate task estimation.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary purpose of Estimation Poker in project management and Agile development?
A: To provide a financial breakdown of tasks and backlog items for budgeting purposes
B: To collaboratively estimating tasks and backlog items using consensus-based technique
C: To serve as a legal assessment tool for project tasks and activities
D: To focus solely on the technical evaluation of tasks and backlog items
Answer: B
Explanation: The primary purpose of Estimation Poker in project management and Agile development is to collaboratively estimate tasks and backlog items using a consensus-based technique. This method involves multiple team members and is based on the premise that collective wisdom leads to more accurate estimates.

Question: How does Estimation Poker help in minimizing bias during the estimation process?
A: By providing a financial analysis of each estimate to ensure accuracy
B: By simultaneously revealing cards to prevent influence among team members
C: By focusing on the legal aspects of estimation to ensure compliance
D: By emphasizing the technical precision of estimates to ensure accuracy
Answer: B
Explanation: Estimation Poker helps in minimizing bias during the estimation process through the simultaneous reveal of cards. This approach prevents team members from being influenced by the estimates of others, thus reducing estimation bias and promoting independent judgment.

Question: What is a key benefit of the collaborative nature of Estimation Poker?
A: It ensures financial accuracy in estimates by involving multiple perspectives.
B: It taps into the collective wisdom of the team, leading to more accurate estimates.
C: It provides a legal consensus on task sizes and backlog items.
D: It focuses on the technical precision of estimates to ensure accuracy.
Answer: B
Explanation: A key benefit of the collaborative nature of Estimation Poker is that it taps into the collective wisdom of the team. By involving multiple perspectives in the estimation process, this technique generally leads to more accurate and well-rounded estimates.

Question: What scale is commonly used in Estimation Poker, and how is it applied?
A: A Fibonacci series, with members picking a card representing the task's relative effort
B: A financial scale, focusing on the cost of each task and backlog item
C: A legal scale, assessing the compliance requirements of each task and backlog item
D: A technical complexity scale, specific to software development tasks and backlog items
Answer: A
Explanation: In Estimation Poker, the Fibonacci series is a commonly used scale for estimation. Team members use cards that correspond to this scale to represent their estimate of the relative effort required to complete a task. This scale is chosen for its intuitive representation of relative sizing.

Question: In what scenarios outside of software development can Estimation Poker be effectively used?
A: In detailed financial planning for project tasks and activities
B: In various project management scenarios where tasks need to be estimated
C: In legal assessments of project tasks and activities to ensure compliance
D: In technical evaluations of project components and activities
Answer: B
Explanation: While primarily used in Agile frameworks for software development, Estimation Poker can also be effectively used in other types of project management scenarios. This application is suitable wherever tasks need to be collaboratively and relatively estimated, regardless of the specific industry or project type.
