# Variance Analysis

Variance Analysis is a powerful tool in business analysis for identifying discrepancies between planned performance and actual results. It quantifies the deviation from a known baseline or expected value. This technique is leveraged to discern the root cause and degree of divergence from what was planned, thereby aiding in making informed decisions for corrective actions.

## Variance in Different Life Cycles

1. **Adaptive Life Cycle**: In agile or adaptive environments, the focus is usually on delivering small, production-ready segments for demonstration and feedback. Due to this, variance analysis is not commonly used in isolation for evaluating business analysis efforts. However, some teams might use it to analyze burndown charts and assess if the observed results significantly diverge from expectations. Essentially, the designation of "done" or "not done" replaces the tracking of percent completion of product backlog items or tasks within them.

2. **Predictive Life Cycle**: In more traditional, predictive life cycles, business analysis efforts are often tracked separately. In these cases, variance analysis can provide valuable insights into discrepancies in the business analysis schedule or degree of completion. These insights might affect the selection and extent of business analysis techniques deployed, as well as stakeholder participation.

## Use in Verifying Requirements

Variance analysis also plays a role in verifying requirements. If a significant difference exists between the expected format and content of a business analysis work product and the actual outcome, this technique can be employed to investigate the causes.

## Use in Performance Metrics

It's important to note that while metrics related to business analysis performance can be useful, they can seldom attribute poor business analysis practices as the sole cause for project or product issues. Other factors involved in product development might equally or more significantly contribute to the observed variances.

## Warnings

Caution is advised when interpreting metrics associated with business analysis. These metrics are seldom able to single out poor business analysis practices as the only contributing factor to discrepancies in project and product development.

In summary, Variance Analysis serves as a critical tool for both identifying and understanding the causes and extent of deviations in business analysis and broader project efforts, thereby facilitating the implementation of corrective measures.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: In an agile project environment, how is Variance Analysis typically utilized in relation to business analysis activities?
A: To compare actual performance against the detailed Business Analysis Plan
B: To assess deviations in the business analysis schedule or degree of completion
C: To analyze burndown charts and assess deviations from expected progress
D: To evaluate the accuracy of stakeholder feedback on delivered segments
Answer: C
Explanation: In agile or adaptive environments, Variance Analysis is often used to analyze burndown charts and assess if the observed results significantly diverge from expectations, rather than tracking percent completion in detail.

Question: When a predictive project's business analysis schedule consistently falls behind, what type of analysis is most beneficial for identifying the underlying reasons?
A: Risk Analysis
B: Variance Analysis
C: Cost-Benefit Analysis
D: Root Cause Analysis
Answer: B
Explanation: In predictive life cycles, Variance Analysis can provide valuable insights into discrepancies in the business analysis schedule or degree of completion, helping identify underlying reasons for schedule delays.

Question: If a project team observes that the actual content of a Business Analysis Work Product significantly differs from what was expected, which technique should they employ to investigate the causes?
A: Requirement Gathering Techniques
B: Stakeholder Analysis
C: Variance Analysis
D: Gap Analysis
Answer: C
Explanation: Variance Analysis is used to investigate significant differences between the expected format and content of a business analysis work product and the actual outcome.

Question: In the context of Variance Analysis, what caution should be exercised when interpreting metrics associated with business analysis?
A: Metrics should not be used in isolation to attribute discrepancies to poor business analysis practices.
B: Metrics should focus solely on financial aspects of project variances.
C: Only qualitative metrics should be considered in Variance Analysis.
D: Variance metrics should always be cross-referenced with stakeholder satisfaction scores.
Answer: A
Explanation: Caution is advised when interpreting metrics associated with business analysis, as these metrics cannot single out poor business analysis practices as the sole cause for discrepancies in project and product development.

Question: How does Variance Analysis in an adaptive life cycle differ from its application in a predictive life cycle?
A: It focuses more on financial variances in an adaptive life cycle.
B: It is used to evaluate stakeholder engagement effectiveness in a predictive life cycle.
C: It is more concerned with the extent of business analysis techniques deployed in an adaptive life cycle.
D: It analyzes burndown charts in an adaptive life cycle, whereas it assesses schedule or degree of completion in a predictive life cycle.
Answer: D
Explanation: In an adaptive life cycle, Variance Analysis often focuses on analyzing burndown charts, whereas in a predictive life cycle, it provides insights into discrepancies in the business analysis schedule or degree of completion.
