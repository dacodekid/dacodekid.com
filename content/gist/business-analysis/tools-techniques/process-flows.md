# Process Flows

Process flows are graphical representations used to visualize the sequence of steps or activities involved in a business process or system. They serve as vital tools for understanding the "as-is" state of a process and are foundational for discussions about the "to-be" or future state. Typically used in business analysis, these flows facilitate what-if analysis and are instrumental in stakeholder discussions.

In the context of process modeling, process flows fall into different categories or levels:

- **Level 1 (L1) Process Flows**: These are high-level diagrams that depict an end-to-end process in seven to ten steps.
- **Level 2 (L2) Process Flows**: These are more detailed flows that break down the steps in an L1 flow, detailing the sub-processes that constitute each major step.

The graphical elements used in process flows usually include boxes to represent steps or tasks, diamonds to indicate decision points, and arrows to show the sequence or flow. Swimlanes may also be used to group tasks performed by specific roles or systems.

**Usage in Projects and Business Analysis**:

- **Elicitation**: Process flows can be employed during elicitation sessions with stakeholders, aiding in the visualization of existing or proposed processes.
- **Analysis**: The diagrams are useful for identifying gaps or missing features by tracking how requirements align with individual steps within the flow.
- **Requirements Verification**: As easily understandable models, process flows can be reviewed by business stakeholders to ensure that requirements are correctly captured.
- **KPI Metrics**: Key Performance Indicators can be overlayed on process flows to measure the efficiency or effectiveness of a process, useful for performance benchmarking.

**Variations of Process Flows**:

1. **Value Stream Maps**: These are specialized process flows that additionally include information on delays, queues, and handoffs in the process. The primary aim is to identify non-value-adding activities that can be eliminated.

2. **Activity Diagrams**: Typically used in the context of software development, these diagrams are used to illustrate the flow of activities and often show both user and system interactions. They are particularly useful for modeling complex workflows or use cases.

3. **Sequence Diagrams**: These diagrams focus on the interaction between different systems or users and the sequence in which these interactions occur. They are particularly useful for technical teams to understand the flow of control and data between different systems or components.

**Relationship to Requirements**:

- Process flows serve as a basis for deriving functional and non-functional requirements. They provide the context in which requirements are defined and analyzed.
- Existing requirements can be traced back to specific steps in a process flow to identify any missing or unnecessary requirements.

Software packages and simulation tools exist to automate the creation and analysis of process flows, which helps in experimenting with different future state scenarios before settling on a solution. These are crucial for decision-making and are often elaborated upon as more information becomes available throughout a project.
