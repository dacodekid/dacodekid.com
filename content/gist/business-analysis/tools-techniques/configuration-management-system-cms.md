# Configuration Management System (CMS)

A Configuration Management System (CMS) is an integrated set of tools, processes, and procedures designed to manage and maintain an organization's changeable assets, primarily in the form of documentation and code. It aims to ensure that all approved versions of configuration items are stored and protected in a manner that enables easy recovery while maintaining the integrity of the stored items.

### Key Components

- **Configuration Items**: These are the specific assets that are placed under configuration management. They could be hardware, software, documentation, or any other elements necessary for a project.

- **Configuration Identification**: This process helps in identifying configuration items for a project. It provides unique identifiers and a classification structure for each configuration item.

- **Configuration Control**: This involves the evaluation, approval or disapproval, and implementation of changes to configuration items. Formal mechanisms are in place to control and update configuration items and their documentation.

- **Configuration Status Accounting**: This is a record-keeping system of all configuration items. It keeps track of changes, statuses, and the individuals who authorized those changes.

- **Configuration Audits**: These are conducted to ensure that the current design and development outputs of a project are consistent with its documented requirements.

### Key Features

- **Documentation**: All changes, the reasoning behind them, and any associated impacts are comprehensively documented.
- **Tracking Process**: A systematic approach is used to follow change requests from initiation through resolution, including status updates at regular intervals.

- **Approval Levels**: Different levels of hierarchy may be involved in authorizing changes. These approval levels are predefined and documented.

- **Verification and Validation**: Before a change is implemented, it is verified and validated to ensure conformance to requirements and to assess any possible ripple effects on dependent items.

- **Baseline Management**: CMS allows for the establishment of baselines at various stages of the project, providing a stable foundation for further development.

The primary goal of a CMS is to ensure that any changes to configuration items are made in a systematic, traceable, and repeatable manner. This helps in mitigating risks associated with changes and ensures that the project remains aligned with its objectives and requirements.
