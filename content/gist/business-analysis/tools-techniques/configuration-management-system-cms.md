# Configuration Management System (CMS)

A Configuration Management System (CMS) is an integrated set of tools, processes, and procedures designed to manage and maintain an organization's changeable assets, primarily in the form of documentation and code. It aims to ensure that all approved versions of configuration items are stored and protected in a manner that enables easy recovery while maintaining the integrity of the stored items.

## Key Components

- **Configuration Items**: These are the specific assets that are placed under configuration management. They could be hardware, software, documentation, or any other elements necessary for a project.

- **Configuration Identification**: This process helps in identifying configuration items for a project. It provides unique identifiers and a classification structure for each configuration item.

- **Configuration Control**: This involves the evaluation, approval or disapproval, and implementation of changes to configuration items. Formal mechanisms are in place to control and update configuration items and their documentation.

- **Configuration Status Accounting**: This is a record-keeping system of all configuration items. It keeps track of changes, statuses, and the individuals who authorized those changes.

- **Configuration Audits**: These are conducted to ensure that the current design and development outputs of a project are consistent with its documented requirements.

## Key Features

- **Documentation**: All changes, the reasoning behind them, and any associated impacts are comprehensively documented.
- **Tracking Process**: A systematic approach is used to follow change requests from initiation through resolution, including status updates at regular intervals.

- **Approval Levels**: Different levels of hierarchy may be involved in authorizing changes. These approval levels are predefined and documented.

- **Verification and Validation**: Before a change is implemented, it is verified and validated to ensure conformance to requirements and to assess any possible ripple effects on dependent items.

- **Baseline Management**: CMS allows for the establishment of baselines at various stages of the project, providing a stable foundation for further development.

The primary goal of a CMS is to ensure that any changes to configuration items are made in a systematic, traceable, and repeatable manner. This helps in mitigating risks associated with changes and ensures that the project remains aligned with its objectives and requirements.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: In a large-scale software development project, the team needs to systematically manage and maintain different versions of their code and documentation. Which system would be most effective in achieving this goal?
A: Project Management Information System (PMIS)
B: Configuration Management System (CMS)
C: Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System
D: Document Management System (DMS)
Answer: B
Explanation: A Configuration Management System (CMS) is designed to manage and maintain changeable assets like documentation and code in an organization, ensuring that all approved versions of these assets are stored and protected systematically.

Question: What is the primary purpose of the Configuration Identification process within a Configuration Management System (CMS)?
A: To define the budget for configuration items and their change
B: To assign unique identifiers and classify configuration items
C: To schedule timelines for configuration changes and updates
D: To allocate resources for managing configuration items and their changes
Answer: B
Explanation: The Configuration Identification process in a CMS helps in identifying configuration items for a project, providing them with unique identifiers and a classification structure, crucial for systematic management.

Question: What role does Configuration Control play in a Configuration Management System (CMS)?
A: It involves the evaluation, approval, and implementation of changes to configuration items
B: It is responsible for the physical storage of configuration items and their documentation
C: It primarily deals with the training of staff on configuration management procedures and processes
D: It focuses on the sales and marketing aspects of configuration items and their changes
Answer: A
Explanation: Configuration Control within a CMS involves the evaluation, approval or disapproval, and implementation of changes to configuration items, ensuring that changes are made systematically and formally.

Question: Why are Configuration Audits an essential component of a Configuration Management System (CMS)?
A: To ensure the project's financial accounting is accurate and up-to-date
B: To ensure design and development outputs align with documented requirements
C: To conduct performance appraisals of the project team members and stakeholders
D: To assess the market viability of the project outputs and deliverables
Answer: B
Explanation: Configuration Audits in a CMS are essential as they ensure that the current design and development outputs of a project are consistent with its documented requirements, maintaining the integrity of the project.

Question: What is the significance of Baseline Management in the context of a Configuration Management System (CMS)?
A: It is used to evaluate the team's performance against set benchmarks and targets
B: It allows for the establishment of baselines, providing a stable foundation for development
C: It focuses on managing the baseline budget of the project and its associated costs
D: It deals with setting baseline sales targets for the project outputs and deliverables
Answer: B
Explanation: Baseline Management in a CMS allows for the establishment of baselines at various stages of the project. These baselines provide a stable foundation for further development and change management.
