# Story Mapping

Story Mapping is a specialized technique predominantly employed in projects that follow an adaptive life cycle. This method is invaluable in organizing and sequencing user stories based on their inherent business value and the typical sequence in which users perform them. The objective is to arrive at a collective understanding within the team of what precisely needs to be built. This shared understanding aids not just in development but also signals where additional analysis may be necessary.

## Components of Story Mapping

Story mapping consists of two primary structural elements:

1. **Backbone**: This represents the core capabilities absolutely required for the initial release to achieve its purpose. Often equated with the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), the backbone is essentially a high-level view, often articulated as features, epics, or even user stories.

2. **Walking Skeleton**: This comprises the complete end-to-end functionalities that stakeholders deem necessary for the solution to be viable or acceptable. Often referred to as the Minimum Marketable Features (MMF), the walking skeleton is usually described by a comprehensive set of user stories.

Individual user stories are arranged vertically under the associated user stories of the walking skeleton. They are prioritized from top to bottom, starting with the highest business value to the lowest.

## Story Mapping and Release Allocation

Another application of story mapping is in release planning. Releases can be represented as horizontal lines on a story map, each effectively demarcating a grouping of functionality based on team capacity and planned release dates. Thus, each horizontal section on the map represents a release, while vertical groupings symbolize functional clusters.

## Role in Prioritization

Though story mapping can act as a standalone prioritization technique, it can also be complemented by other prioritization methods. By offering a spatial and logical organization of what needs to be built, it assists product teams in understanding the sequence in which features or components should be developed and released to customers.

## Utility in Business Analysis

From the vantage point of business analysis, story mapping offers a structured approach to identifying gaps in user capabilities, thereby informing the business analyst where more rigorous analysis might be necessary. By laying out the whole picture in a structured format, it allows stakeholders and team members to better understand the scope, scale, and complexities involved, making it an invaluable tool for effective business analysis in adaptive environments.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary purpose of employing Story Mapping in projects following an adaptive life cycle?
A: To provide a budgeting and financial forecast for the project.
B: To establish a clear hierarchy of team roles and responsibilities.
C: To organize and sequence user stories for collective understanding and effective development.
D: To serve as a legal documentation for project deliverables.
Answer: C
Explanation: Story Mapping in adaptive life cycle projects is used to organize and sequence user stories, aiding in achieving a collective understanding within the team about what needs to be built, rather than focusing on budgeting, team hierarchy, or legal documentation.

Question: In Story Mapping, what does the 'Backbone' represent?
A: A detailed technical specification for each feature.
B: Core capabilities required for the initial release, similar to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
C: The project's marketing and sales strategies.
D: A comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation plan.
Answer: B
Explanation: The 'Backbone' in Story Mapping represents the core capabilities required for the initial release, often equated with the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It is not about technical specifications, marketing strategies, or risk management.

Question: How is the 'Walking Skeleton' in Story Mapping defined?
A: As a preliminary budget outline for the project.
B: As the complete end-to-end functionalities necessary for the solution to be viable.
C: As a comprehensive list of all stakeholders involved in the project.
D: As the project's detailed schedule with exact timelines.
Answer: B
Explanation: The 'Walking Skeleton' comprises the complete end-to-end functionalities that are necessary for the solution to be viable or acceptable, often referred to as the Minimum Marketable Features (MMF). It is not related to budgeting, stakeholder listing, or detailed scheduling.

Question: What role does Story Mapping play in release planning?
A: It is used to assign individual tasks to team members.
B: It represents releases as horizontal lines, grouping functionality based on team capacity and release dates.
C: It is primarily employed for post-release customer support planning.
D: It focuses on determining the pricing model for each release.
Answer: B
Explanation: In release planning, Story Mapping represents releases as horizontal lines on the map, with each horizontal section representing a release and vertical groupings symbolizing functional clusters. It is not about task assignments, customer support, or pricing models.

Question: How does Story Mapping assist in business analysis in adaptive environments?
A: By providing a template for legal contracts between the organization and its clients.
B: By offering a structured approach to identify gaps in user capabilities and inform rigorous analysis.
C: It is used exclusively for external stakeholder communication.
D: By detailing the technology stack to be used in product development.
Answer: B
Explanation: From a business analysis perspective, Story Mapping in adaptive environments offers a structured approach to identifying gaps in user capabilities and informs where more rigorous analysis might be necessary. It is not about legal contracts, external communication, or technology decisions.
