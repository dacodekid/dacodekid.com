### Needs Assessment

#### [Identify Problem or Opportunity](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/identify-problem-or-opportunity.md)

The process of "Identify Problem or Opportunity" is often the triggering point of any business analysis effort. This process focuses on discovering, understanding, and clarifying the gaps or challenges within an organization or system that offer room for improvements or new ventures. Here, business analysts engage with stakeholders to gain an in-depth understanding of the existing conditions and to identify what is either hindering the organization from reaching its objectives or what new avenues can be explored. The process is crucial because ==if the problem or opportunity is not thoroughly understood, the organization may end up pursuing an inadequate solution==.

#### [Assess Current State](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/assess-current-state.md)

Following the identification of a problem or opportunity, the next step is to "Assess the Current State of the Organization." During this stage, the business analyst captures a 'snapshot' of the organization's present condition by examining various elements such as processes, systems, capabilities, and stakeholder relationships. Techniques like MOST analysis (Mission, Objectives, Strategies, Tactics), as-is process modeling, and gap analysis could be used. This provides a foundational understanding upon which future changes can be mapped.

#### [Determine the Future state](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/determine-the-future-state.md)

After the current state has been thoroughly assessed, the process moves to "Determine the Future State." This involves envisioning what the organization should look like after addressing the identified problem or seizing the opportunity. It also entails setting future objectives, and defining criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs) that would indicate the successful achievement of this envisioned future. Techniques like to-be process modeling, benchmarking, and balanced scorecards are often employed during this stage.

#### [Determine the viable option and provide recommendation](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/determine-the-viable-option-and-provide-recommendation.md)

"Determining the Viable Option and Providing Recommendation" is a critical decision-making stage. Multiple alternatives to reach the future state may exist, and each comes with its own sets of costs, benefits, risks, and impacts. Business analysts evaluate these options using techniques like decision analysis, feasibility studies, and cost-benefit analysis. A recommendation is then made, which provides the best course of action to take, given the organization's constraints and objectives.

#### [Facilitate product roadmap development](/content/gist/business-analysis/processes/facilitate-product-roadmap-development.md)
