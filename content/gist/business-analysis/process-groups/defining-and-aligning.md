# Defining and Aligning

This process group revolves around the initial phases of a product's lifecycle. It involves:

- Evaluating the feasibility of introducing a new product, modifying an existing one, or retiring an old product.
- Understanding the overall viability and potential return on investment.
- Establishing a clear scope that defines what the product will encompass.
- Ensuring that the product, as well as associated portfolios, programs, and projects, align with the overarching organizational strategy.

Essentially, this process group ensures that any new initiative or change aligns with the organization's objectives and will bring tangible benefits.
