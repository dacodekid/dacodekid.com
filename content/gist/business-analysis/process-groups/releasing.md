# Releasing

The culmination of the product's development phase:

- Decisions are made on whether to release all or a segment of the solution.
- Stakeholder acceptance is sought, ensuring they are satisfied with the product.
- Once accepted, the solution is transitioned to an operational team responsible for its ongoing maintenance and management.

This process group ensures a smooth transition from development to operations, making sure the solution meets stakeholder needs and is ready for real-world application.
