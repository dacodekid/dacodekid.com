# Initiating

As the name suggests, this group is about setting the stage:

- It involves defining the objectives of the portfolio, program, or project.
- Resources are allocated to specific components or phases of the initiative.
- Stakeholders are identified, and initial communications are established.

The goal here is to lay a firm foundation and provide clear direction for the ensuing stages.
