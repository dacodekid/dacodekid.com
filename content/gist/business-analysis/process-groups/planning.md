# Planning

The heart of project preparation lies here:

- This group is about devising the best strategy for conducting business analysis activities.
- Tailoring the approach based on the chosen project lifecycle is essential.
- A comprehensive stakeholder analysis is performed to understand their influence and interactions with the solution being developed.

A well-crafted plan ensures that business analysis activities align with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.
