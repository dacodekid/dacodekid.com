# Executing

This is where the rubber meets the road:

- Elicitation techniques are used to gather information about the product.
- Analysis and modeling are performed to make sense of the gathered data.
- Requirements, user stories, constraints, and other product information are defined, verified, validated, prioritized, and approved.

The focus is on generating tangible outputs that drive the product's development.
