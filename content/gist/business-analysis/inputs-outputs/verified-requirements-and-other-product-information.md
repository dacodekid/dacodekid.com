# Verified Requirements And Other Product Information

"Verified Requirements and Other Product Information" refers to the set of requirements and associated product details that have undergone an evaluation process to ensure they are free from errors and conform to predefined quality standards. This concept is a critical element in the business analysis process, serving as a foundation for subsequent activities like validation, prioritization, and approval.

### Key Points

1. **Error-Free**: Verification ensures that the gathered requirements and other product information are accurate and free from errors. This involves checks for completeness, consistency, and other quality attributes.

2. **Quality Standards**: The verification process aligns with quality standards that are predefined and agreed upon by stakeholders. This ensures that all requirements meet a certain level of quality before they move on to subsequent stages like validation or implementation.

3. **No Guarantee of Business Alignment**: It is crucial to note that just because requirements are verified does not mean they automatically align with the business needs or goals. Verification is more about 'building the thing right,' while validation is about 'building the right thing.'

4. **Inputs to Other Processes**: Once verified, these requirements and product information often serve as inputs to other business analysis processes or project activities. They may be presented to stakeholders for further review, validation, and eventual approval.

5. **Verification and Validation**: Although both activities can technically occur in any order or even concurrently, they are often sequenced. Requirements are usually verified for quality and accuracy before they are validated for effectiveness in meeting business objectives.

6. **Comprehensive Review**: Requirements and product information typically undergo both verification and validation processes before being presented to stakeholders for final review and approval. This ensures not only quality but also relevance and alignment with business goals.

In essence, verified requirements and other product information are critical assets that have been rigorously evaluated for quality and accuracy. They serve as reliable inputs for other business analysis activities, including validation and stakeholder approval, contributing to the overall success and quality of the solution.
