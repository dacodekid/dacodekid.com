# Viable Product Design Options

"Viable Product Design Options" are formulations of how a solution or a component of a solution can be structured to achieve the defined business goals and objectives. These options are not mere conceptual sketches; they are subjected to rigorous stakeholder review to ensure they are both practical to implement and aligned with business needs.

### Components of Viable Product Design Options

1. **Representation**: Each design option is typically presented in a format that can include diagrams, mockups, specifications, and other descriptive forms that make it easy for stakeholders to understand the design.

2. **Feasibility Analysis**: The options go through an assessment to ensure they are practical from a technical, financial, and operational standpoint.

3. **Alignment with Business Goals**: Each design option must demonstrate how it contributes to achieving the business objectives laid out at the beginning of the business analysis process.

4. **Pros and Cons**: A balanced view is presented for each design option, detailing the advantages and disadvantages. This could include factors like cost, time, resource requirements, scalability, and risk.

### Decision Making

After presenting viable product design options, stakeholders typically engage in a decision-making process to select the most suitable design. This could involve:

- **Weighted Scoring**: Each design option could be scored against predefined criteria to objectively determine its suitability.

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: The costs and benefits of each design option could be quantified and compared.

- **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks associated with each design option are identified and evaluated.

- **Stakeholder Consensus**: Sometimes, a simple majority vote or consensus among key stakeholders may be used to finalize the option.

### Post-Selection Steps

Once a design option is selected:

1. **Solution Construction**: The build phase begins, adhering to the selected design.

2. **Validation and Verification**: Continuous checks are performed to ensure that the solution under construction aligns with the selected design and ultimately satisfies the business objectives.

3. **Iteration**: Depending on the development methodology in use (Agile, Waterfall, etc.), there may be iterations or phases where the solution is progressively developed and refined.

By presenting stakeholders with viable product design options, the business analysis process facilitates informed decision-making, minimizes risks, and sets the stage for the effective construction of a solution that meets organizational needs.
