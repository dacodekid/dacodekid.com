# Relationships And Dependencies

"Relationships and Dependencies" refer to the intricate web of linkages that exist between various requirements, components of product information, project work, and deliverables in business analysis. These relationships and dependencies serve multiple critical functions and are identified and managed across different stages of the business analysis process.

### Types of Relationships

- **Parent to Child**: These relationships exist as requirements are progressively elaborated from a high-level scope to a more detailed set of specifications. The parent requirement serves as a broader statement of need, while child requirements provide the granularity.

- **Dependency Relationships**: These can take various forms such as:
  - **Implementation Dependency**: One requirement needs to be implemented before or alongside another.
  - **Benefit Dependency**: The realization of benefits from one requirement is dependent on another.
  - **Value Dependency**: The value derived from one requirement is contingent on another.

### Functions of Relationships and Dependencies

1. **Adding Business Value and Meeting Customer Expectations**: Establishing clear linkages helps ensure that the product or solution will satisfy customer needs and contribute positively to business goals.

2. **Scope Management**: Understanding how requirements relate can prevent scope creep and help manage changes effectively.

3. **Identifying Missing Requirements**: By understanding dependencies, thereâ€™s a lower risk of overlooking essential requirements.

4. **Impact Analysis**: Knowing the relationships can help in assessing the ramifications of changes to one or more requirements.

5. **Release Decisions**: Dependencies may influence the sequencing of requirements implementation and thus, the release plans.

6. **Prioritization Choices**: Dependencies can influence which requirements are more urgent or essential, affecting their prioritization.

7. **Batch Approval**: Sometimes, the relationships and dependencies indicate that certain requirements may need to be selected and approved as a package rather than individually.

### Concurrent Processes

The identification and management of relationships and dependencies are not a one-time event. As the business analysis progresses, the business analyst might discover additional linkages. This identification is often performed in conjunction with the specific process described in Section 8.2, which deals explicitly with establishing relationships and dependencies.

"Relationships and Dependencies" serve as the architectural framework for managing requirements effectively. They enable business analysts to take a holistic view, considering the myriad ways in which different elements interconnect, thereby contributing to more informed decision-making and better project outcomes.
