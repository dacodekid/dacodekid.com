# Business Analysis Organizational Standards

The concept of "Business Analysis Organizational Standards" is crucial in setting the expectations and benchmarks for business analysis activities within an organization.

## Scope of Standards

These standards extend over a broad array of elements, ranging from the conduct of business analysis to the tools that should be employed to support these efforts. They serve as the overarching guidelines and procedures that business analysts within the organization are expected to adhere to.

## Inclusion of KPIs

These organizational standards often incorporate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which serve as metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and quality of business analysis activities. These KPIs provide quantifiable measures for assessing business analysis performance against established benchmarks.

## Quality Characteristics

The standards also delineate the expected quality characteristics that should be inherent in all business analysis deliverables. These can include, but are not limited to:

- Feasibility
- Conciseness
- Measurability
- Testability
- Traceability
- Unambiguity
- Precision
- Consistency
- Correctness
- Completeness
- Prioritization

These quality characteristics essentially define what constitutes a 'good' requirement or set of requirements.

## Formatting and Syntax Rules

The standards might also specify formatting rules and syntax rules to be followed in business analysis deliverables. This ensures uniformity and coherence in the way the business analysis data and information are presented.

## Alignment with Industry Standards

In many cases, the organizational standards for business analysis are influenced by or based on prevailing industry standards. This alignment enhances the credibility, interoperability, and external validity of the business analysis activities within the organization.

## Verification and Phases

Particularly in predictive approaches, the standards may define what level of quality is required for requirements before transitioning from one phase of the project to another. This adds an additional layer of quality control to the process.

## Models and Predefined Standards

Organizational standards might also cover the verification of analysis models against predefined modeling standards. This ensures that any models used align with both internal guidelines and any applicable external standards.

In essence, Business Analysis Organizational Standards serve as both a roadmap and a measuring stick for business analysis activities, ensuring alignment with organizational objectives, while also facilitating continuous improvement and quality assurance.
