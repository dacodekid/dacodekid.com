# Evaluated Acceptance Results

Evaluated Acceptance Results play a crucial role in determining whether a solution has met, exceeded, or failed to meet the predefined acceptance criteria. These results are essentially comparisons between what was expected (acceptance criteria) and what was actually delivered (actual results).

## Components

- **Comparison**: At its core, evaluated acceptance results involve a side-by-side comparison between the acceptance criteria and the actual results that the solution produced.

- **Root Cause Analysis**: If there are variances or defects, the root cause for such discrepancies is identified.

- **Cost Analysis**: The cost to address any identified defects is analyzed.

- **Business Impact**: An assessment is made regarding the business impact of either addressing the defect or letting it persist.

## Utility

- **State of the Product**: These results articulate the state of the product in terms of its proficiencies and deficiencies, thereby giving a clear picture of how the product may have affected the expected business value.

- **Future Opportunities**: A product that exceeds expectations can pave the way for future opportunities.

- **Defect Handling**: Conversely, a product that falls short may possess defects that require further attention. This necessitates a cost-benefit analysis to decide whether to fix the defects or accept them.

## Documentation and Communication

- Some organizations may choose to track these evaluated results and accompanying recommendations in logs.

- When communicated, the evaluated acceptance results may also include recommendations on how to deal with identified defects.

## Lifecycle Considerations

- In projects following an adaptive life cycle, the 'Definition of Done' is also considered as a part of evaluated acceptance results.

- These results also offer concrete evidence about whether or not the solution has met or exceeded expectations, which can impact the decision on when and if the solution is accepted for release.

## Long-term Maintenance

For organizations maintaining long-term documentation about their projects, another facet of evaluated acceptance results can be obtained by comparing the approved requirements with the as-built documentation.

Evaluated Acceptance Results are comprehensive assessments that not only serve as performance indicators for the delivered solution but also guide subsequent actions and decisions. They are indispensable for understanding the actual value delivered by the solution, planning corrective actions if necessary, and aligning the project's outcomes with business objectives.

## Quiz

Question: What is the primary purpose of Evaluated Acceptance Results in a project?
A: To define the project's marketing strategy and plans
B: To compare actual results with predefined acceptance criteria
C: To establish the project's budget allocation and financial plan
D: To outline the legal framework of the project and its activities
Answer: B
Explanation: Evaluated Acceptance Results are focused on comparing the actual results of a solution with the predefined acceptance criteria, determining whether the solution has met, exceeded, or failed to meet these criteria.

Question: How do Evaluated Acceptance Results contribute to understanding the state of the product?
A: By focusing solely on the financial aspects of the product and its development
B: By articulating the product's proficiencies and deficiencies in relation to the acceptance criteria
C: By establishing the final technical specifications of the product
D: By determining the marketing potential of the product and its features
Answer: B
Explanation: Evaluated Acceptance Results give a clear picture of the state of the product in terms of its proficiencies and deficiencies, indicating how it has affected the expected business value.

Question: What aspect is considered in Evaluated Acceptance Results for projects following an adaptive life cycle?
A: The 'Definition of Done'
B: The project's budget allocation and financial plan
C: The legal compliance of the project
D: The aesthetic design of the product
Answer: A
Explanation: In projects with an adaptive life cycle, the 'Definition of Done' is a key consideration in Evaluated Acceptance Results, contributing to the assessment of whether the solution meets the expectations.

Question: What kind of analysis is typically conducted if Evaluated Acceptance Results reveal variances or defects?
A: Root Cause Analysis and Cost Analysis
B: Aesthetic Analysis and Design Analysis
C: Marketing Analysis and Sales Analysis
D: Legal Compliance Analysis and Regulatory Analysis
Answer: A
Explanation: If variances or defects are identified in Evaluated Acceptance Results, Root Cause Analysis to identify the reasons for discrepancies and Cost Analysis to evaluate the cost of addressing defects are typically conducted.

Question: In the context of Evaluated Acceptance Results, what is often assessed regarding defects?
A: The business impact of addressing or ignoring the defects
B: The color scheme of the defects
C: The marketing potential of the defects
D: The legal implications of the defects
Answer: A
Explanation: When defects are identified in Evaluated Acceptance Results, an assessment is made regarding the business impact of either addressing the defect or letting it persist, guiding decision-making on corrective actions.
