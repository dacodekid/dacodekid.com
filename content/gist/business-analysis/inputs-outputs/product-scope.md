# Product Scope

Product Scope is a critical aspect in the field of business analysis, serving as the foundational framework that outlines the features and functions that characterize a solution. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

### Definition and Nature

Product scope is essentially comprised of the features and functions that define a particular solution. It is inherently tied to the specific viable option selected from the "Determine Viable Options and Provide Recommendation" process. This means that depending on which option is chosen by decision-makers, the product scope will vary accordingly.

### Initial Formation

The initial product scope is determined once the business case has been approved. The solution approach that is approved establishes the initial set of capabilities and features of the product. At this stage, the understanding of the product scope is at a high level. During the charter development, the initial product scope is also often elucidated through high-level product requirements. Out-of-scope features may also be clearly identified in the charter to prevent misunderstandings and set clear boundaries.

### Refinement Process

After the initial scope is established, it is not static but goes through a continuous refinement process. As the product team proceeds with further analysis and as more information becomes available, the product scope is adjusted and fine-tuned.

### Responsiveness to Change

Throughout an initiative, the product scope may undergo revisions. These changes can be in response to evolving business needs, emerging risks, or constraints such as budget and schedule. Therefore, the product scope is adaptable and should be responsive to the dynamics of the business environment.

### Role in Various Processes

- **Transition Planning**: Understanding the product scope helps in making decisions on how the transition should proceed. It helps identify any special resources and coordination that may be required.

- **Elicitation**: The product scope is crucial for elicitation activities, as it sets the boundaries and context for what information needs to be gathered. For example, if the elicitation is focused on solution requirements, existing stakeholder and business requirements can offer a foundational basis.

Product Scope is an evolving element, defined by features and functions that characterize a solution. It is set initially based on approved solution approaches and is refined as the initiative progresses. It acts as a guiding framework for various business analysis processes including but not limited to transition planning and elicitation. It is subject to changes based on multiple factors including business needs, risks, and other constraints.
