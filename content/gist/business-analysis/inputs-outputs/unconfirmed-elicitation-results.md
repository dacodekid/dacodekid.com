# Unconfirmed Elicitation Results

Unconfirmed Elicitation Results are the initial outcomes from completed elicitation activities within the business analysis process. These results haven't yet undergone a validation or review process, and therefore, they are considered "unconfirmed" until further validated by stakeholders or additional activities.

### Documentation

The manner in which these results are documented can range in formality. On the informal end of the spectrum, a simple snapshot of a whiteboard containing preliminary requirements could suffice. On the more formal end, specialized requirements management tools may be used for documentation.

The primary form of this documentation often consists of a set of "elicitation notes," which serve as a valuable repository of information for carrying out other business analysis processes. These notes can encompass a broad range of formats such as sketches, diagrams, models, flipcharts, photos, videos, audio recordings, sticky notes, and index cards.

### Consolidation and Organization

Post-elicitation, these documented results are consolidated and organized in a structured manner that facilitates review, understanding, and subsequent validation. This is an essential step to ensure that the elicited information is coherent and aligns with original source materials or the understanding of those who provided the information.

### Evolution into Confirmed Elicitation Results

The transition from unconfirmed to confirmed elicitation results occurs through a process of review and validation. Stakeholders or other subject matter experts often undertake this review. The aim is to reach a common understanding regarding the accuracy and relevance of the information gathered. Once this consensus is reached, unconfirmed elicitation results are then elevated to the status of confirmed elicitation results.

In essence, unconfirmed elicitation results serve as a starting point in the business analysis process. They are gathered through various elicitation activities and can exist in multiple formats. The critical aspect is that these results are subject to further validation and review to evolve into confirmed elicitation results, making them a reliable foundation for subsequent stages in the business analysis process.
