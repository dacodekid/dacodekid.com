# Confirm Elicitation Results

Confirm Elicitation Results refers to the critical step in the business analysis process where the information gathered through elicitation techniques is verified for accuracy and completeness. This process is integral to ensuring that the requirements gathered are indeed reflective of the stakeholders' needs and expectations. It serves as a quality check before the requirements are formally documented or used in subsequent activities such as analysis, documentation, and validation.

Key Elements in Confirming Elicitation Results:

1. **Follow-Up Activities**: After elicitation, additional activities may be needed to clarify, expand upon, or validate the information gathered. This could include additional interviews, focus groups, or reviewing supplemental documents.

2. **Level of Formality**: Based on the nature of the project, regulatory constraints, and stakeholder expectations, the business analyst determines the level of formality required for confirming elicitation results. In some cases, a formal review meeting may be necessary, while in others, an informal confirmation may suffice.

3. **Stakeholder Review**: The elicitation results are presented to stakeholders for review. This step is crucial for ensuring that the requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and expectations. Stakeholders may include business owners, end-users, or even regulatory bodies.

4. **Accuracy and Completeness**: During the stakeholder review, attention is given to the accuracy and completeness of the elicitation results. Any gaps or discrepancies are identified and addressed, either through further elicitation or clarification.

5. **Comparison to Historical Information**: Past projects, lessons learned, and historical data can provide valuable context. Comparing current elicitation results to historical information can reveal patterns or inconsistencies that may need further investigation.

6. **Documentation**: Once confirmed, the elicitation results are documented formally. The level of detail in this documentation will depend on the project needs, stakeholder expectations, and any applicable regulatory requirements.

7. **Transition to Subsequent Processes**: After confirmation, the elicitation results typically feed into subsequent business analysis processes like requirement analysis, solution evaluation, or directly into the development lifecycle depending on the project methodology being used.

Confirming elicitation results is not merely a checkpoint but a rigorous activity aimed at ensuring that the right requirements are identified accurately. Failure to do so can lead to misalignment between the solution and the business needs, resulting in wasted effort, time, and resources.
