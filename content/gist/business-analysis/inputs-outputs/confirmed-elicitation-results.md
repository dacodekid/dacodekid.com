# Confirm Elicitation Results

Confirm Elicitation Results refers to the critical step in the business analysis process where the information gathered through elicitation techniques is verified for accuracy and completeness. This process is integral to ensuring that the requirements gathered are indeed reflective of the stakeholders' needs and expectations. It serves as a quality check before the requirements are formally documented or used in subsequent activities such as analysis, documentation, and validation.

They represent a form of elicitation results that have undergone a process of validation and consensus-building among the product team and other stakeholders.

### Common Understanding

One of the critical attributes of confirmed elicitation results is that they signify a "common understanding" among the project's product team. This means that all involved parties are in agreement about the accuracy of the elicited information.

### Formation

Confirmed elicitation results can be arrived at in two primary ways:

- **Post-Elicitation Review**: After the elicitation activities are completed, a group of stakeholders reviews the materials. Their consensus on the accuracy of the information transitions the results from "unconfirmed" to "confirmed."
- **Concurrent Confirmation**: Alternatively, confirmation can occur in real-time as elicitation activities are being carried out.

### Components

Confirmed elicitation results comprise various types of information, including notes, requirements, and other outputs from completed elicitation activities. These form the foundational data for creating first-draft models and for further analysis.

### Utility in Various Contexts

- **Model Creation**: Confirmed elicitation results often serve as the base for creating first-draft models. As these models are further examined, additional questions about scope, processes, rules, data, or interfaces may arise that necessitate further elicitation activities.
- **Draft Requirements Identification**: These confirmed results often serve as a starting point for identifying draft requirements. Typically, this information is collected from subject matter experts (SMEs) or identified in source materials during the elicitation activities.

- **Gap Analysis**: The confirmed elicitation results are crucial in identifying and filling gaps within the project. They are used in conjunction with analysis models to ensure that the entire solution is holistically examined, preventing missing, inconsistent, or conflicting requirements.

### Not the Final Requirements

It's essential to note that even though confirmed elicitation results have gained a level of validation and agreement, they are not considered "final requirements" until they have undergone further analysis. They are merely a more solidified form of the raw elicitation results that provide a reliable foundation for subsequent project phases.

In summary, confirmed elicitation results serve as an agreed-upon informational foundation for various business analysis processes, from creating initial models to identifying draft requirements and performing gap analysis. Their "confirmed" status indicates that they have reached a level of validation and consensus among stakeholders, making them more reliable for progressing through subsequent phases of the project.
