# Recommended Solution Option

The "Recommended Solution Option" comes into focus particularly during solution evaluation. This recommendation serves as the guided course of action to effectively meet the business need or solve a problem. It is based on comprehensive analysis and evaluation of all viable options, factoring in elements like financial impacts, operational efficiency, and stakeholder preferences among others.

## Components of Recommended Solution Option

- **Best Option from Analysis**: This is derived after considering the complete results of the various types of analyses undertaken, including financial analysis.

- **Decision-making Process**: It is important to provide a high-level overview of the methodology or process that was followed to reach this decision.

- **Subjective Criteria**: If the decision-making process included any subjective or qualitative criteria, these should be explicitly stated. Transparency in this aspect can provide context and may be crucial for stakeholder buy-in.

## Levels of Decision-Making

- **Portfolio or Program Level**: At this level, the focus is broad and involves making a recommendation that aligns with the overall goals and strategies of the portfolio or program.

- **Project Level**: Here, the recommendation is more focused and will typically include a high-level description of the product(s) to be developed as part of the project.

## Inclusion in Business Case

In practical terms, the recommended solution option is often presented in the business case document. This presentation includes not just the recommendation itself but also supporting information that furnishes the rationale behind the selection. This supporting information may include data, analysis results, and other elements that build the case for the recommended option.

The "Recommended Solution Option" is a crucial output that encapsulates informed and strategic decision-making.
