# Solution Design

In the realm of Business Analysis, the term "Solution Design" refers to a comprehensive set of specifications and diagrams that articulate the future state of the organization. It serves as a pivotal input for transitioning from the current state to this envisioned future state.

### Constituents of Solution Design

1. **Specifications**: Detailed requirements that lay out what needs to be achieved. These could be functional specifications, non-functional requirements, or even constraints that the solution should adhere to.

2. **Diagrams**: Visual representations such as flowcharts, architecture diagrams, or data models that provide a graphical view of the solution.

3. **Business Procedure Specifications**: These could include process flows that detail the step-by-step procedures that need to be followed within the business environment.

### Relationship with Business Analysis

The specifications and diagrams in the solution design are usually an extension of the product information that has been identified and elaborated upon during the business analysis process. However, solution design goes beyond what is specified by business analysis alone, delving into areas that may require specialized knowledge in disciplines like IT architecture, engineering, or domain-specific expertise.

### Role of Business and Enterprise Architecture

When feasible and beneficial, the solution design should leverage the existing features of the business and enterprise architecture. This alignment ensures that the solution design is not just a standalone entity but is integrated into the broader organizational strategy and infrastructure.

### Comparative Assessment

The solution design may also be compared against proposed solution design options. This comparison serves to shed light on potential design challenges that may need to be addressed during the transition phase to the future state.

### Purpose and Implications

- **Transition Readiness**: The solution design helps in preparing the organization for the transition to the future state, serving as a roadmap of what needs to be achieved.

- **Design Challenges**: By comparing the solution design with proposed options, the organization can preemptively identify obstacles that may impede the transition, thereby facilitating more effective risk management and planning.

The solution design serves as an instrumental framework that facilitates the transition to a future state by providing detailed specifications, diagrams, and potentially, business procedure specifications. It works in tandem with business analysis and should ideally be aligned with the broader business and enterprise architecture of the organization.
