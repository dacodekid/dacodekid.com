# Analysis Models

Analysis Models are visual or graphical representations that encapsulate product information. These models can vary in their level of detail and complexity, ranging from high-fidelity, semantically correct representations to low-fidelity sketches or drafts.

## Versatility Across Project Lifecycle

These models are dynamic and evolve throughout the portfolio, program, or project. In other words, models may be created at different phases of the project and can be draft or fully completed versions. The diversity of models is expected, and not all types of models will be relevant for every project.

## Functionality and Purpose

The primary utility of Analysis Models lies in multiple areas:

1. **Multi-Faceted Representation**: They provide a multi-dimensional view of the solution, giving various stakeholders a more comprehensive understanding of what is being developed or proposed.

2. **Gap Identification**: These models are instrumental in identifying any inconsistencies, gaps, or omissions in the requirements or the solution itself.

3. **Elaboration and Derivation**: Analysis Models serve as tools for elaborating requirements, whether these are high-level business requirements, user stories, or detailed functional requirements.

4. **Error Detection**: They help in identifying redundancies and errors, thereby contributing to the quality of the requirements.

5. **Attribute Definition**: Some models assist in defining the attributes associated with the requirements.

6. **Acceptance Criteria**: In certain cases, especially when working with user stories, Analysis Models may be used to define or derive acceptance criteria.

## Iterative Nature

The development and use of Analysis Models are iterative processes. As you go through cycles of analysis, the models may need to be revised, refined, or even replaced to better suit the evolving requirements or to correct identified issues.

## Utility in Different Scenarios

Different types of Analysis Models can help derive requirements in diverse ways. For instance, Business Objectives Models may be employed to establish acceptance criteria at the product or business objectives level.

## Summary

Analysis Models are integral to the Business Analysis process, offering a structured mechanism for visualizing, analyzing, and refining product information and requirements. By using Analysis Models, Business Analysts can ensure more robust requirements gathering, facilitate better stakeholder communication, and contribute to the overall success of the portfolio, program, or project.
