# Validated Requirements And Other Product Information

Validated Requirements and Other Product Information refer to the set of requirements and related product details that have undergone a validation process and are agreed upon by stakeholders as aligning with business goals and objectives. It is important to note that having validated requirements doesn't necessarily mean they are well-written or meet project standards. Here's an in-depth look into various facets:

## Components

1. **Requirements**: These are conditions or capabilities needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective.

2. **Other Product Information**: This could include specifications, models, user stories, or any other documentation that gives context or additional details about the product.

## Verification vs Validation

1. **Verification**: This is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements.

2. **Validation**: This is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it fulfills the intended use. Validation ensures that 'you built the right thing,' while verification ensures that 'you built it right.'

Although both verification and validation can happen in any sequence, they often occur in tandem. Once both processes are complete, the validated and verified requirements are then presented to stakeholders for further review and approval.

## Stakeholder Agreement

The validation process involves stakeholder agreement, ensuring that the requirements and product information align with business goals and objectives. This consensus is critical for the success of the project as it assures that all parties have a shared understanding of what is to be delivered.

## Inputs for Other Processes

Validated requirements and other product information serve as critical inputs for various other business analysis processes. They help in forming the basis for further development activities, testing, and other operational processes.

## Additional Steps

- **Prioritization**: Once validated, the requirements also need to be prioritized based on their importance, necessity, and impact on the project.
- **Approval**: After validation and prioritization, the requirements go through an approval process, usually involving key stakeholders, before they are finalized.

Therefore, validated requirements and other product information are pivotal in ensuring that a project is aligned with business objectives and has the stakeholder buy-in, forming a solid foundation for the project's subsequent phases.

C: Verification focuses on financial aspects, whereas validation does not consider them
D: Validation is only about legal compliance, while verification is not concerned with it
Answer: A
Explanation: Validation is the process of ensuring that the system or component fulfills its intended use ('you built the right thing'), while verification evaluates whether it meets the specified requirements ('you built it right').

Question: What role do stakeholders play in the validation of requirements and product information?

Explanation: Stakeholder agreement is critical in the validation process to ensure that the requirements and product information align with business goals and objectives, assuring a shared understanding among all parties.

Question: What happens to requirements after they have been validated?
A: They are disregarded for the remainder of the project
B: They undergo prioritization and approval processes
C: They solely focus on the aesthetic design of the product
D: They are only used to determine the financial budget
Answer: B
Explanation: After being validated, requirements typically undergo further processes like prioritization based on their importance and impact, followed by an approval process involving key stakeholders.

Question: Why are validated requirements and product information important for other business analysis processes?
A: They are irrelevant to other business analysis processes and are only used for development
B: They form the basis for further development, testing, and operational processes
C: They solely focus on the financial aspects of other processes and activities
D: They only dictate the aesthetic design aspects of other processes
