# Validated Requirements And Other Product Information

Validated Requirements and Other Product Information refer to the set of requirements and related product details that have undergone a validation process and are agreed upon by stakeholders as aligning with business goals and objectives. It is important to note that having validated requirements doesn't necessarily mean they are well-written or meet project standards. Here's an in-depth look into various facets:

### Components

1. **Requirements**: These are conditions or capabilities needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective.

2. **Other Product Information**: This could include specifications, models, user stories, or any other documentation that gives context or additional details about the product.

### Verification vs Validation

1. **Verification**: This is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements.

2. **Validation**: This is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it fulfills the intended use. Validation ensures that 'you built the right thing,' while verification ensures that 'you built it right.'

Although both verification and validation can happen in any sequence, they often occur in tandem. Once both processes are complete, the validated and verified requirements are then presented to stakeholders for further review and approval.

### Stakeholder Agreement

The validation process involves stakeholder agreement, ensuring that the requirements and product information align with business goals and objectives. This consensus is critical for the success of the project as it assures that all parties have a shared understanding of what is to be delivered.

### Inputs for Other Processes

Validated requirements and other product information serve as critical inputs for various other business analysis processes. They help in forming the basis for further development activities, testing, and other operational processes.

### Additional Steps

- **Prioritization**: Once validated, the requirements also need to be prioritized based on their importance, necessity, and impact on the project.
- **Approval**: After validation and prioritization, the requirements go through an approval process, usually involving key stakeholders, before they are finalized.

Therefore, validated requirements and other product information are pivotal in ensuring that a project is aligned with business objectives and has the stakeholder buy-in, forming a solid foundation for the project's subsequent phases.
