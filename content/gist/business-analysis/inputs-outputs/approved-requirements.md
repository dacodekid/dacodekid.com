# Approved Requirements

Approved requirements ==undergo a two-fold process of verification and validation==.

## Verification

Verification ensures that the requirements are of "sufficient quality." This aspect focuses on confirming that the requirements are well-defined, unambiguous, and clear. This is essentially a quality control step to make sure that the requirements are up to standard before they go any further in the project lifecycle.

## Validation

Validation, on the other hand, confirms that the requirements meet the underlying business needs. This step ensures that the requirements are not only well-written but are also aligned with the strategic goals and objectives of the business. The key stakeholders often participate in this process to affirm that the specified requirements serve the business purpose.

## Approval Mechanisms

==Once the requirements are both verified and validated, they gain the status of "approved."== This approval is an indication that stakeholders with decision-making authority are in agreement with the requirements as they stand. How these requirements get approved could vary. It may involve written sign-offs, or in some scenarios, even verbal acceptance is considered sufficient. During the planning stage, the product team determines the approval process, including identifying the roles that should participate in this process.

## Adaptation in Different Project Lifecycles

- **Adaptive Life Cycle**: In projects using an adaptive life cycle, the approved requirements often take the form of a prioritized backlog ready for development. They could also be in the form of "stories" that have been selected from the product backlog as the planned work for the upcoming or a future iteration.
- **Predictive Life Cycle**: In predictive projects, once the requirements are reviewed and approved, they establish a "==requirements baseline==." Change requests in such a lifecycle are evaluated against this baseline for impact analysis.

## Functionality in Subsequent Processes

Approved requirements ==serve as a baseline for various comparisons== and assessments in the later stages of the project. For example, they are used to conduct impact analysis when changes are proposed in predictive life cycles. They are also employed for making release decisions to ascertain the congruence between what was initially approved and what has been implemented.

In summary, approved requirements are pivotal in setting the trajectory of the project, serving as a basis for future development, comparisons, and evaluations.

## Quiz

```quiz
Question: What is the primary focus of the verification process for requirements?
A: Ensuring financial feasibility of the requirements
B: Confirming that the requirements are well-defined and clear
C: Assessing the legal implications of the requirements
D: Allocating resources based on the requirements
Answer: B
Explanation: Verification of requirements focuses on confirming that they are well-defined, unambiguous, and clear, essentially checking the quality of the requirements before they proceed further in the project lifecycle.

Question: What does the validation process for requirements primarily confirm?
A: The alignment of requirements with legal standards
B: That requirements are aligned with the strategic goals and business needs
C: The resource allocation for the requirements
D: The communication strategy for the project
Answer: B
Explanation: Validation confirms that the requirements not only are well-written but also align with the strategic goals and objectives of the business, ensuring they meet underlying business needs.

Question: How do approved requirements function in predictive project life cycles?
A: They establish a "requirements baseline" for the project
B: They are used only for stakeholder communication
C: They solely focus on the financial aspects of the project
D: They determine the legal contracts for the project
Answer: A
Explanation: In predictive project life cycles, approved requirements establish a "requirements baseline," against which any change requests are evaluated for impact analysis.

Question: What is an indicator that requirements have achieved "approved" status?
A: Stakeholders have been informed about the requirements
B: Stakeholders with decision-making authority agree with the requirements
C: The project budget has been allocated based on the requirements
D: The legal team has reviewed the requirements
Answer: B
Explanation: The approval of requirements indicates that stakeholders with decision-making authority are in agreement with the requirements as they stand.

Question: In an adaptive life cycle, how are approved requirements typically manifested?
A: As a finalized project budget
B: As a prioritized backlog ready for development
C: As a legal document for stakeholder agreements
D: As a fixed communication plan for the project
Answer: B
Explanation: In projects using an adaptive life cycle, approved requirements often take the form of a prioritized backlog ready for development, including "stories" selected for upcoming iterations.
