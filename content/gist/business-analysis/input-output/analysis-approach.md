# Analysis Approach

The Analysis Approach is a foundational document that outlines the methodology and practices to be followed in analyzing business needs, capturing requirements, and managing product information throughout the portfolio, program, or project lifecycle. ==It is a dynamic document that may undergo changes as the project progresses==.

### Components

The Analysis Approach comprises several key components:

1. **Methodology for Analysis**: It details how business analysis will be conducted, setting the stage for uniform practices.

2. **Verification and Validation**: It describes the procedures for ensuring that the requirements are accurate, complete, and will meet the intended purpose.

3. **Prioritization**: It includes the criteria and methods for ranking requirements based on business importance, dependencies, and other factors.

4. **Risk Analysis**: It outlines how risks associated with requirements and other product information will be identified and analyzed.

5. **Design Option Assessment**: Guidelines for evaluating different solutions or design options are provided.

6. **Analytical Techniques and Templates**: The approach specifies which techniques like SWOT Analysis, MOST Analysis, etc., and templates are expected to be used during the analysis.

7. **Requirements Attributes**: It determines what attributes of the requirements need to be captured for effective management and tracking.

8. **Requirements Architecture**: This outlines how different requirements and models relate to each other and is crucial for modeling elaboration.

9. **Information and Models**: It describes what existing organizational information or models might be referenced or used during the analysis process.

### Evolving Nature

The Analysis Approach is not static. As models are analyzed, new types may emerge that necessitate an update to the original approach. For example:

- **Candidate Models**: The approach includes a list of candidate models to be created, and new models may be added as the analysis progresses.

- **Modeling Elaboration**: The approach informs which models are most likely to relate to one another for the purpose of detailed elaboration.

### Scope Across Project Lifecycle

The Analysis Approach defines:

- **Types of Requirements**: The types of requirements to be elaborated throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Storage of Information**: How the requirements and other product information will be stored or documented.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: It provides directives on when and how acceptance criteria will be defined and their relationship with user stories, requirements, releases, and solution definitions.

### Importance in Business Analysis

The Analysis Approach serves as a strategic framework that guides Business Analysts in delivering value by ensuring that all facets of analysis are clearly planned and executed in alignment with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.

By adhering to a well-defined Analysis Approach, Business Analysts can achieve consistency in deliverables, mitigate risks effectively, and ensure that the end product meets the intended business needs.
