# Actual Acceptance Results

### Overview

Actual Acceptance Results are the outcomes of comparing the test results with the predefined Acceptance Criteria. They are a quantifiable record of whether the product, feature, or functionality meets the conditions specified for acceptance. Typically, these results contain a pass/fail status and are often provided by a quality control team.

### Role in Business Analysis

In the context of business analysis, these results are not just recorded but are also analyzed thoroughly. The aim is to understand the discrepancy, if any, between the test results and the Acceptance Criteria. This understanding is crucial for recommending corrective measures or solutions to address the defects or shortcomings in the deliverables.

### Regression Testing

For organizations that engage in regression testing, the Actual Acceptance Results from these tests can be invaluable. Regression tests are meant to check if new or enhanced functionalities have negatively impacted existing functionalities. By analyzing regression test results along with actual acceptance results, Business Analysts can uncover situations where recent changes have introduced unintended consequences.

### Addressing Defects

Upon identifying any differences between the test results and the acceptance criteria, recommendations are made to address the defects. These could range from minor adjustments to significant changes in the product, feature, or functionality being examined.

### Importance in Quality Control

These results play a critical role in quality control processes. By establishing a concrete record of the product's alignment with stakeholder requirements and expectations, Actual Acceptance Results serve as an accountability tool for both the development team and stakeholders.

### Strategic Decision-Making

They are also instrumental in making strategic decisions regarding the project's future. For instance, if the results reveal frequent or major discrepancies, this could call for a reconsideration of the project scope, timelines, or even the overall approach.

By systematically analyzing Actual Acceptance Results, Business Analysts can ensure that the solution meets the Acceptance Criteria and, consequently, stakeholder requirements and expectations. This is vital for the project's success and for achieving the intended business outcomes.
