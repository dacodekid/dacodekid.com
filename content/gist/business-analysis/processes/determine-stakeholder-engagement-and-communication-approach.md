# Determine Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach

The **Determine Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach** process is pivotal in devising efficient strategies for interacting with stakeholders during the product's life cycle. This is based on an in-depth analysis of their roles, interests, and requirements within the business analysis process.

## Key Benefits

- It offers a systematic approach to engage stakeholders in business analysis and requirement-based activities.
- It ensures stakeholders get the correct information via the most effective communication methods and frequencies to fulfill the needs of the initiative and meet stakeholder anticipations.

## Primary Components

1. **Level of Involvement**: This pertains to the participation of each stakeholder or their group, often rooted in the RACI and other classifications of stakeholders found in the stakeholder register.

2. **Decision-making Approaches**: These methodologies, such as consensus-based decisions, decisions by sponsors, or decisions by weighted analysis, are collectively formulated with inputs from stakeholders while considering organizational norms and standards.

3. **Approvals**: It includes the identification of who has the authority to approve or reject requirements, and the level of formalities required for such approvals, like if a sign-off is needed and the medium of sign-off (electronic signature or email).

4. **Information Management**: This encompasses how product and project details will be structured, saved, and maintained to keep all stakeholders informed. Organizational standards for knowledge repositories, tools for requirements management, modeling, agile teams, and record retention influence the available choices.

5. **Stakeholder Updates**: It takes into account which stakeholders need specific information and their preferences for the details' depth, communication frequency, and the time zones they are in. Additionally, organizational choices for communication media, such as technology available, authorized media, videoconferencing, remote collaboration tools, and security needs are taken into account.

For stakeholders outside the organization, it's essential to maintain consistent messaging, often achieved by routing communications through specific contact points.

## Considerations

- Tailoring the communication to the needs of stakeholders is crucial, but when it gets overly intricate, it can become time-consuming.
- Key questions to guide communication include: Who needs this information? Is a formal document required? Can the information be shared differently?

## Overlap with Other Roles

There's notable overlap between the business analysis view on stakeholder engagement and communication and the perspective of portfolio, program, and project managers. While overlaps are present, the emphasis differs among the roles. Business analysts concentrate on engagement during product development, whereas the other roles focus on their specific domains.

Business analysts must collaborate with portfolio, program, and project managers to identify the stakeholders, determine their engagement level, and steer clear of redundancies in communication. Moreover, business analysts may depend on or cooperate with these managers to obtain the required commitment from stakeholders.

## Engagement & Communication Formality

Engaging and communicating with stakeholders can range from being highly formal to very informal. In organizations that lean towards formality, this approach becomes a part of a structured business analysis plan. In contrast, adaptive life cycle efforts inherently have 'planning communication' built into them, eliminating the need for a formal activity.

Regardless of the formality level, the thought process behind this engagement and communication is paramount for effective product development. If overlooked, stakeholder involvement might become irregular, risking insufficient engagement for elicitation, analysis, decision-making, and potential misrepresentation of stakeholder interests. Additionally, if stakeholder communication preferences aren't regarded, it can negatively influence solution choices and their development.

## Inputs

### [Situation Statement](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/situation-statement.md)

The Situation Statement is a concise description of a problem or an opportunity. It defines the current state, its discrepancies, and the desired future state. This statement provides a foundation for further analysis and aids stakeholders in understanding the context and reason for the project or initiative.

### [Updated Stakeholder Register](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/updated-stakeholder-register.md)

An Updated Stakeholder Register is an evolving document that lists and characterizes the stakeholders of a project or initiative. It captures their interests, influence, concerns, and potential impact on the project. This register assists in identifying who needs to be engaged, and in what capacity, throughout the project's lifecycle.

## Tools and Techniques

### [Elicitation Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/elicitation-techniques.md)

Elicitation Techniques are methods employed to gather information from stakeholders. These techniques ensure that all relevant data, requirements, and feedback are collected to provide a holistic understanding of stakeholder needs and expectations.

### [Persona Analysis](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/persona-analysis.md)

Persona Analysis involves creating detailed, hypothetical profiles representing different user types within a targeted demographic, attitude, or behavior set. These profiles aid in understanding and anticipating stakeholder needs and behaviors, ensuring solutions are tailored to their specific requirements.

### [RACI Model](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/raci-model.md)

The RACI Model is a responsibility assignment matrix that defines the roles and responsibilities in relation to tasks or deliverables. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. This model helps ensure clear communication and ownership for each task, clarifying roles and minimizing overlaps or gaps.

### [Retrospectives and Lessons Learned](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/retrospectives-and-lessons-learned.md)

Retrospectives and Lessons Learned sessions are reflective practices where teams review their processes and outcomes to identify what went well, what could be improved, and how to implement these improvements in future endeavors. These insights contribute to continuous improvement and better stakeholder engagement.

### [Stakeholder Maps](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/stakeholder-maps.md)

Stakeholder Maps are visual representations that display stakeholders in relation to their power, interest, influence, or other relevant attributes. These maps aid in understanding stakeholder dynamics, enabling more effective engagement strategies.

## Outputs

### [Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/stakeholder-engagement-and-communication-approach.md)

The Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach outlines how stakeholders will be engaged throughout the project or initiative. It defines the methods, frequency, content, and channels of communication, ensuring that stakeholders are adequately informed and involved. This approach is vital for fostering collaboration, managing expectations, and achieving successful outcomes.
