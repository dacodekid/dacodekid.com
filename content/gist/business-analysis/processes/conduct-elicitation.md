# Conduct Elicitation

Conduct Elicitation is a crucial process within business analysis where different elicitation techniques are used to gather information from stakeholders and other relevant sources. The primary aim of this process is to procure the necessary details to adequately define and elaborate on the requirements and other pertinent product information.

## Benefits

- **Information Gathering**: It facilitates the collection of information from the right sources.

- **Requirement Elaboration**: It helps in adequately defining and expanding on the requirements and other essential product details.

## Components

1. **Inputs**:
   The sources of information that will be referred to or used during the elicitation process. These could be previously gathered data, documents, or any other relevant resources that would help in the information-gathering process.

2. **Tools and Techniques**:
   Various methods and practices employed to gather information. This could range from interviews, focus groups, observations, to document analysis, and more.

3. **Outputs**:
   The results or the information gathered after the elicitation process. This could be in the form of detailed requirements, specifications, or any other relevant data that has been derived from the inputs using the tools and techniques.

The Conduct Elicitation process is about harnessing the right techniques to gather the most accurate and relevant information from stakeholders, which will then inform the requirements and other product details. This ensures that the resulting product or solution meets the actual needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders.

## Inputs

### [Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/product-scope.md)

The Product Scope describes the features, functions, and characteristics of a product, service, or result. It serves as a foundational element in determining the elicitation approach. Understanding the scope helps in selecting appropriate elicitation techniques and stakeholders for involvement.

### [Situation Statement](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/situation-statement.md)

The Situation Statement outlines the current condition and the desired condition of the organization or project. It acts as a reference point for identifying the necessary information to be elicited and helps in framing relevant questions and topics for discussion during elicitation activities.

### [Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/stakeholder-engagement-and-communication-approach.md)

The Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach outlines the plan for engaging stakeholders and managing communications throughout the business analysis activities. This approach influences the selection of elicitation techniques by considering stakeholders' preferences, communication channels, and engagement levels.

### [Stakeholder Register](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/stakeholder-register.md)

The Stakeholder Register is a comprehensive list of stakeholders who may affect or be affected by the project. It provides valuable insights into stakeholders' interests, influence, and potential contributions to the elicitation process.

## Tools and Techniques

### [Brainstorming](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/brainstorming.md)

Brainstorming is a collaborative technique used to generate a wide range of ideas, solutions, or approaches. It encourages open and uninhibited participation from stakeholders, fostering creativity and innovation in identifying requirements and opportunities.

### [Interviews](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/interviews.md)

Interviews are structured or unstructured conversations with stakeholders aimed at eliciting information, insights, and perspectives. They provide an in-depth understanding of stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints, and the context surrounding the product scope.

### [Retrospectives and Lessons Learned](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/retrospectives-and-lessons-learned.md)

Retrospectives and Lessons Learned involve reflecting on past projects or phases to identify successes, failures, and areas for improvement. This information is crucial in shaping the elicitation approach for current and future initiatives.

## Outputs

### [Elicitation Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-approach.md)

The Elicitation Approach is a structured plan that outlines the methods and techniques to be used for eliciting information from stakeholders. It considers the inputs, such as the product scope and situation statement, to ensure that the elicitation process is tailored to the specific needs and context of the project.
