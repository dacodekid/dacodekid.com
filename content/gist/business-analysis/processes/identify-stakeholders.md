## Identify Stakeholders

The process of "Identify Stakeholders" revolves around pinpointing the individuals, groups, or organizations that have a potential impact, are impacted, or even think they might be impacted by the area being assessed. This process is essential because it pinpoints whose concerns and inputs must be considered throughout all business analysis activities.

### Definition

- **PMBOK® Guide Definition**: The PMBOK® Guide describes a stakeholder as any individual, group, or organization that could influence, be influenced by, or think they might be influenced by a decision, activity, or result of a portfolio, program, or project.

- **Business Analysis Definition**: When it comes to business analysis, a stakeholder is defined slightly differently. Here, a stakeholder is any individual, group, or organization that might influence, be influenced by, or perceive themselves as being influenced by the solution. In this context, such stakeholders can be described as "product stakeholders".

Product stakeholders are actively involved in identifying requirements. They provide crucial inputs during requirements elicitation by delivering business analysis data. This data then forms the foundation for shaping product requirements. It's important to note that stakeholder identification is fluid. An individual or group that identifies or perceives themselves as a product stakeholder at the beginning might see their role or perception change as more details about the situation and product requirements unfold. As the solution progresses, product teams utilize the defined product scope and results from analysis to make necessary modifications to the list of stakeholders. In the context of this standard and guide, whenever the term "stakeholder" is used, it's referring to those influenced by the solution, implying the term "product stakeholder".

### Collaboration is Key

The act of identifying stakeholders isn't exclusive to business analysis. It's also an integral part of portfolio, program, and project management. Given this overlap, there's a significant chance of redundant or overlapping efforts. Hence, collaboration becomes crucial. By collaborating, business analysis and portfolio, program, and project management can ensure that their efforts are streamlined and complementary, with no redundancy or gaps. Such a collaborative approach not only optimizes efforts but also paves the way for better outcomes.

### Inputs:

#### [Elicitation Results (Unconfirmed/Confirmed)](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

Elicitation results, whether unconfirmed or confirmed, provide valuable insights into the needs, preferences, and expectations of various parties involved in the project. This information becomes a foundational input in identifying stakeholders, as it reveals who has expressed interest or concerns related to the project's objectives and outcomes.

#### [Enterprise and Business Architectures](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Enterprise and Business Architectures define the organization's structure, processes, systems, and strategic objectives. It serves as a blueprint that showcases various entities and their interdependencies within the organization. Utilizing this architecture aids in identifying key players and departments that might have a vested interest in the project or its outcomes.

#### [Situation Statement](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

A situation statement provides a clear and concise description of a problem or opportunity faced by the organization. By understanding the context and implications of the situation, business analysts can pinpoint stakeholders who are directly or indirectly impacted by it.

### Tools and Techniques:

#### [Brainstorming](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Brainstorming is a collaborative technique where team members collectively generate ideas or solutions to a problem. In the context of identifying stakeholders, brainstorming can help in thinking outside the box and uncovering potential parties that might have been overlooked.

#### [Interviews](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Interviews involve one-on-one interactions where specific questions are posed to gather detailed information. When trying to identify stakeholders, interviews can be conducted with known parties to inquire about others who might have a stake in the project.

#### [Organizational Charts](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Organizational charts visually represent the hierarchy and structure of an organization. By studying these charts, business analysts can identify departments, teams, and individuals who might be stakeholders based on their position or role in relation to the project.

#### [Process Flows](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Process flows depict the sequence of activities in a particular process. By analyzing these flows, one can determine the parties involved at various stages, thus helping in stakeholder identification.

#### [Questionnaires and Surveys](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Questionnaires and surveys are tools used to gather information from a larger group of people. Distributing these among potential stakeholders or the broader organization can help identify those with interests or concerns related to the project.

### Outputs:

#### [Stakeholder Register](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

The stakeholder register is a comprehensive document that lists all identified stakeholders, along with relevant information about them, such as their role, influence, and interest in the project. This register becomes a primary reference point for stakeholder engagement and communication activities throughout the project lifecycle.
