# Determine Analysis Approach

The process of Determine Analysis Approach is centered around strategizing how business analysis will be executed. It encompasses decisions regarding which facets will be analyzed, the most effective models to be used, and the methodologies for verifying, validating, and prioritizing requirements and other related product information. The primary advantage of this process is facilitating a collective understanding of the scope and nature of the business analysis work required for the solution's development.

The analysis approach clarifies:

1. **Relevant Product Information:** This pertains to the specific kind of product data that will be taken into account during business analysis.

2. **Beneficial Models:** A forethought regarding which models are most valuable to produce during the process.

3. **Requirements Attributes:** These are specific characteristics or properties linked to requirements. They are explored in greater detail in "Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide".

4. **Requirements Life Cycle:** In a predictive delivery framework, the life cycle delineates the various stages a requirement undergoes, such as definition, elaboration, verification, validation, and prioritization. In adaptive delivery, these stages might be more implicit, with requirements often marked as not ready, ready, or done. Here, 'done' aligns with the successful delivery and acceptance of the solution segment that meets the requirement.

5. **Requirements Architecture:** The analysis approach makes use of the established requirements architecture. This architecture outlines the interrelations between requirements, models, and other product data.

6. **Appropriate Analysis Models:** These are the most fitting models for the task, highlighting their traceability to each other.

7. **Analysis Activities and Tools:** The approach also outlines the pertinent analysis activities, the foundational templates for documenting requirements, the tools to be employed, and any potential modifications to these elements.

8. **Documentation Norms:** For entities with less stringent documentation needs, the approach could dictate whether informal notes or sketches from sessions are to be retained or if more structured documentation is warranted.

9. **Analysis Activities & Techniques:** This involves considerations about the potential utility of analysis activities and techniques, the timing of their application, the stakeholders to be involved, and the ideal format for any resulting artifacts.

10. **Concurrent Elicitation:** Effective analysis often runs parallel to elicitation. As analysis tends to raise significant queries about the situation, further elicitation becomes necessary. Irrespective of the project life cycle, the processes of elicitation and analysis are generally iterative and closely intertwined. Thus, determining the analysis approach is a recurring activity throughout the lifespan of a portfolio, program, or project.

In essence, while it's not mandatory to finalize all techniques before initiating the analysis, forward planning ensures that business analysts are better equipped to deploy a range of techniques. Some analysis might remain unplanned until the actual execution phase. In certain scenarios, the pre-established analysis approach may just be revised as per evolving needs.

## Inputs

### [Elicitation Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-approach.md)

Elicitation Approach encompasses the strategies and methods adopted during the elicitation phase to gather requirements and pertinent information from stakeholders. The chosen approach may vary based on the complexity of the project, stakeholder availability, and nature of the information required.

### [Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/product-scope.md)

Product Scope refers to the features, functionalities, and characteristics of a product or service. It encompasses the boundaries and extent to which the project will be undertaken and delivers a clear understanding of what is included and excluded from the product.

### [Situation Statement](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/situation-statement.md)

The Situation Statement is a concise description of the current state, challenges, and the desired state of an organization or project. It aids in providing clarity about the problem or opportunity the project aims to address.

### [Traceability and Monitoring Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/traceability-and-monitoring-approach.md)

The Traceability and Monitoring Approach refers to the strategies and tactics used to track and monitor the relationship between requirements and other aspects of the project. It ensures that all requirements are being addressed and aids in managing changes effectively.

## Tools and Techniques

### [Brainstorming](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/brainstorming.md)

Brainstorming is a collaborative technique where a group of people gather to generate a wide range of ideas related to a specific topic. It promotes creative thinking and encourages participants to freely share ideas without judgment.

### [Document Analysis](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/document-analysis.md)

Document Analysis involves examining and evaluating documents related to the project to extract relevant information. This technique helps in understanding existing processes, systems, and challenges, and aids in identifying areas of improvement.

### [Retrospectives and Lessons Learned](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/retrospectives-and-lessons-learned.md)

Retrospectives and Lessons Learned are techniques used to reflect on past projects or phases to identify what went well and what can be improved. It helps in continuously improving the process and ensures that mistakes are not repeated in future endeavors.

## Outputs

### [Analysis Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/analysis-approach.md)

The Analysis Approach outlines the methods, tools, and techniques that will be used to analyze the elicited requirements and information. It provides a roadmap for how the analysis will be conducted to ensure that the requirements align with the project objectives and stakeholder expectations.
