## Prepare for Elicitation

**Definition:**
Prepare for Elicitation refers to the systematic process of organizing and planning the resources, tools, and materials required for a specific elicitation activity. This process ensures that the elicitation activities are organized in a manner that maximizes their effectiveness. It ensures clarity among participants about their roles and the expected outcomes of the elicitation activity.

**Significance of Elicitation Preparation:**

1. Elicitation preparation is essentially the groundwork carried out before embarking on the actual elicitation activity.
2. The materials prepared serve to aid the facilitator, making certain that the elicitation is productive, and the time allocated with stakeholders is optimized.
3. In more extensive elicitation scenarios, the preparation might be even more time-intensive than the elicitation itself.
4. The extent of preparation varies based on the elicitation's aim and the technique chosen. For instance:
   - For large workshops, guiding documents might be drafted to streamline discussions.
   - When using collaborative games, the game's setup and a clear instruction manual will be part of the preparation.
   - Informal notes might also be prepared to assist in facilitating the session. These notes can also be a way to gauge the progress against what was intended and modify plans for upcoming elicitation activities.

**Key Activities Involved in Preparing for Elicitation:**

1. **Objective Setting:** Each elicitation activity should have a clear objective. This is essentially the primary reason for undertaking the elicitation. The activity should yield value, justifying the time and resources invested.
2. **Participant Identification:** It's essential to determine who will participate in the elicitation activity. Choosing the wrong participants can lead to inefficiencies or not meeting the objective. Participants who are unfamiliar with the subject matter or the elicitation techniques might need additional training or time.
3. **Resource Identification:** Some activities necessitate supporting materials or access to current systems and documents. Securing these resources is part of the preparation process.
4. **Question Formulation:** Before conducting the elicitation, it's crucial to outline the questions that will guide the session. This ensures that the activity's objectives are met. Additionally, the business analyst should also plan how the elicitation results will be documented and if any help is needed for the elicitation, and collaborate with those resources beforehand.
5. **Agenda Setting:** Clearly defining the topics of discussion or exploration and establishing time limits can help participants know what's expected of them. If participants need to do any groundwork before the session, they should be consulted. Relevant preparation materials, such as presentations or models, should be shared in advance. Sometimes, analysis models might be crafted as part of the preparation to guide the elicitation activity.
6. **Scheduling:** It's vital to allocate suitable durations for each stakeholder group. Also, securing necessary tools and materials, including the meeting room and equipment like projectors, is part of the preparation.

In summary, the process of preparing for elicitation ensures that all activities are streamlined, participants are well-informed, and the necessary tools and materials are in place. This results in an effective and value-driven elicitation process.

### Inputs

#### [Elicitation Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

The elicitation approach involves defining strategies and methods to gather necessary information from stakeholders. It provides a clear direction for the elicitation activities, ensuring that the appropriate data is collected in an efficient manner. The chosen approach must be tailored to the specific project environment, stakeholder needs, and nature of the information required.

#### [Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Product scope refers to the features, functionalities, and characteristics of a product or service that needs to be delivered. It provides a boundary for the product, distinguishing what is included and what is not. A well-defined product scope ensures that stakeholders have a clear understanding of the product's intended purpose and attributes.

#### [Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

This pertains to all the detailed specifications, constraints, and information related to the product. Requirements define what the product should do or the characteristics it should possess. Other product information can include design specifications, user stories, and use cases. Together, these elements provide a comprehensive view of the desired product.

#### [Situation Statement](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

A situation statement provides a concise description of the current scenario or problem the project aims to address. It sets the context for the elicitation activities, helping stakeholders understand the underlying issues and the need for the project.

#### [Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

This approach outlines how stakeholders will be involved in the project and how communication will be managed. It identifies stakeholder needs, preferences, and potential challenges, ensuring that they are engaged effectively throughout the elicitation process.

### Tools and Techniques

#### [Document Analysis](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Document analysis involves reviewing existing documentation to extract relevant information. It's an effective method to gather data on historical, legal, or technical aspects of the project. By analyzing documents, business analysts can identify gaps, inconsistencies, or areas that require further exploration.

#### [Interviews](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Interviews are structured conversations where business analysts interact directly with stakeholders to gather information. They allow for in-depth exploration of topics, providing insights into stakeholder needs, preferences, and concerns. Through interviews, business analysts can validate, refine, and expand on the information obtained from other sources.

### Outputs

#### [Elicitation Preparation Materials](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

Elicitation preparation materials are documents or tools prepared in anticipation of the elicitation activities. They may include questionnaires, checklists, interview guides, or any other resources that assist in facilitating the elicitation process. Properly prepared materials ensure that the elicitation activities are structured and yield valuable results.
