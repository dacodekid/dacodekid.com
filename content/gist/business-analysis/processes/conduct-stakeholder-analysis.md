# Conduct Stakeholder Analysis

The process of Conduct Stakeholder Analysis revolves around investigating both quantitative and qualitative data concerning entities that may influence, be influenced, or believe they are influenced by the area being assessed. Its prime advantage lies in yielding valuable insights regarding stakeholders. These insights are pivotal in:

- Opting for the right elicitation and analysis techniques.
- Deciding the suitable stakeholders to involve during different phases of business analysis efforts.
- Deciding on the most effective methods of communication and collaboration.

Stakeholder analysis delves deep into a systematic examination of both quantitative and qualitative details to comprehend stakeholder attributes and ascertain their interests and positions concerning the solution. Carrying out this analysis during the planning phase aids the product team in recognizing how stakeholders can impact or influence the business analysis process from an early stage. The results of this analysis guide the formulation of effective strategies to engage and communicate with stakeholders throughout the project, especially during activities related to requirements.

An iterative approach is adopted for stakeholder analysis, ensuring it remains relevant and updated throughout the project. As stakeholders' attributes or relationships undergo change or new stakeholders come into the picture, revisiting the analysis becomes crucial. Tweaks in the product scope can lead to the inclusion or exclusion of stakeholders. Although the preliminary planning phase results in an initial list of stakeholders, continuous identification ensures its upkeep. If a vast number of stakeholders emerge, the analysis might lean towards classifying them based on shared characteristics, making the analysis more efficient.

## Characteristics

Various can be scrutinized during the stakeholder analysis to gain more profound insights about them:

- **Attitude**: It determines who is supportive, interested, or inclined to back the task and endorse the proposed solution.

- **Experience**: It offers insights about the stakeholder's familiarity concerning the industry, the organization, and the proposed solution, which they can contribute to the team during the business analysis process.

- **Interests**: This aspect discerns stakeholders who might experience positive or negative outcomes from the solution. Such outcomes could subsequently cast positive or negative effects on the activities related to requirements.

- **Level of Influence**: This characteristic identifies individuals possessing sway within the organization or the product team, which could either obstruct or back the proposed solution.

While a plethora of characteristics can be evaluated, it is the responsibility of the product team to decide which ones are imperative to consider. For an in-depth discussion on stakeholder analysis and their characteristics, refer to Section 3.3 of Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide.

## Inputs

### [Elicitation Results (Unconfirmed/Confirmed)](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

Elicitation results, which can be either unconfirmed or confirmed, are the outcomes obtained from various elicitation techniques employed to gather requirements or information from stakeholders.

This input is crucial in stakeholder analysis as it can help determine which stakeholders might be impacted by changes or have influence over certain areas within these architectures.

### [Situation Statement](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/situation-statement.md)

The Situation Statement provides a clear description of a problem, opportunity, or directive being addressed. It acts as a reference point for the stakeholder analysis, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the current business situation.

### [Stakeholder Register](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/stakeholder-register.md)

The Stakeholder Register contains a list of all individuals, groups, or entities that have an interest in a project or initiative. It typically includes information such as stakeholder roles, responsibilities, interests, and influence levels.
