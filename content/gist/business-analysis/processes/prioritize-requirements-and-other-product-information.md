# Prioritize Requirements and Other Product Information

This process focuses on grasping how each fragment of product data meets the stakeholder's goals. Using this comprehension, along with other agreed-upon prioritization elements, the requirements and work are ranked. The primary advantages include aligning all involved parties on how the requirements achieve objectives and deciding the distribution of requirements across iterations or releases.

## Significance

- **Scope Management:** Managing product scope is essential, and prioritizing requirements is a crucial step in this management.

- **Determining Order of Work:** It establishes the sequence in which tasks should be performed to realize business objectives in a manner that aligns with the organization's needs.

- **Focus on Value:** The essence of prioritization is centering on what delivers the utmost value.

- **Level of Prioritization:** Any level of product data, from overarching business needs to specific functional requirements, is subject to prioritization.

- **Supporting Release Planning:** Prioritization aids in assigning requirements to specific iterations or releases.

- **Factors for Prioritization:** Requirements and other product specifics, like issues or defects, are ranked based on factors such as their value, cost, complexity, compliance with regulations, and associated risks.

## Role

While business analysts may propose prioritization, it is pivotal for stakeholders possessing the requisite authority to be actively involved in this process. Business analysts:

- **Facilitate and Negotiate:** They play a crucial role in aiding and mediating prioritization decisions.

- **Setting Expectations:** Early on in the business analysis process, it's essential to set stakeholder expectations about the prioritization methodology. This proactive approach prevents potential conflicts when some requirements are ranked lower.

- **Skills Utilized:** Negotiation, conflict resolution, and facilitation are vital skills employed during prioritization dialogues.

## Prioritization Timings and Iterations

The prioritization might be done in iterations or at once, and this is influenced by the project's life cycle. It determines the prioritization's regularity, timing, and the methods employed.

## Two-Pronged Effort

Generally, prioritization involves two main steps:

1. **Business Stakeholder Prioritization:** Here, business stakeholders, subject matter experts, or product owners rank requirements based on perceived business value.

2. **Team Assessment:** The second step involves the project team gauging the effort and risk associated with each requirement. The business analyst guides these discussions and collaborates with the team to ensure that top-priority requirements align with the project's boundaries.

## Fluidity

It's worth noting that prioritization outcomes aren't set in stone. As the project unfolds, the importance of requirements can shift. Factors that influence prioritization can evolve, and requirements can be modified. The project's life cycle provides guidance on managing these priority shifts. Changes in priority, or the introduction of new requirements, are meticulously tracked and communicated to relevant stakeholders. Typically, validation precedes prioritization, but both processes can occur simultaneously. Different approaches have varying sequences. In adaptive methodologies, high-level features might be initially prioritized, followed by user stories. Conversely, in predictive methodologies, the entire set of requirements is likely finalized and validated prior to prioritization.

## Inputs

### [Elicitation Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-approach.md)

The analysis approach serves as a structured method for carrying out business analysis tasks. It determines how requirements are to be identified, modeled, and managed. The approach must align with organizational standards, methodologies, and best practices.

### [Business Goals and Objectives](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/business-goals-and-objectives.md)

These are the targets that the organization aims to achieve. Business goals and objectives provide context and guidance for prioritization. They help in ensuring that the requirements being worked on are aligned with the organization's strategic direction.

### [Change Requests](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/change-requests.md)

Requests to modify a product, including its requirements, design, or functionality. It's essential to evaluate and prioritize these change requests in context with existing requirements and the business goals.

### [Relationships and Dependencies](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/relationships-and-dependencies.md)

Requirements often have relationships and dependencies with other requirements. Understanding these relationships is vital for determining sequencing, impacts of changes, and ensuring coherence in requirements prioritization.

### [Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/requirements-and-other-product-information.md)

This encompasses all the documented needs that a particular product must fulfill. It includes both functional and non-functional requirements. Prioritization ensures that the most critical requirements are addressed first.

## Tools and Techniques

### [Backlog Management](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/backlog-management.md)

It is the process of ordering and managing product requirements or user stories in a backlog. This tool helps in sequencing requirements based on their importance, value, and dependencies.

### [Goal Model and Business Objectives Model](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/goal-model-and-business-objectives-model.md)

These models provide a visual representation of organizational goals and how various requirements and initiatives align with these goals. They help in ensuring alignment and in prioritizing requirements effectively.

### [Iteration Planning](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/iteration-planning.md)

This involves planning the activities for a particular iteration or sprint in agile methodologies. Requirements are selected and prioritized for inclusion based on their value and readiness.

### [Kanban Board](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/kanban-board.md)

A visual tool that helps in tracking work items as they move through various stages of the process. It aids in understanding the flow of requirements and helps in prioritizing and managing work based on capacity and dependencies.

### [Prioritization Schemes](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/prioritization-schemes.md)

Defined criteria or methods used to prioritize requirements. Common schemes include MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have), Value vs. Effort, and Risk vs. Reward.

### [Story Mapping](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/story-mapping.md)

A visual representation of user stories or requirements, arranged in a way that provides a holistic view of the user journey. It helps in understanding the big picture and in prioritizing requirements based on user needs.

### [Traceability Matrix](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/traceability-matrix.md)

A table that maps requirements to their sources or other related items. It ensures that each requirement can be traced back to its origin and helps in understanding the impact of changes.

## Outputs

### [Prioritized Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/prioritized-requirements-and-other-product-information.md)

This is the result of the prioritization process. It ensures that efforts are focused on the most critical and valuable requirements first, aligning with business goals and objectives.
