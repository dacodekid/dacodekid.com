# Validate Requirements

The Validate Requirements process is pivotal in ensuring that the stated requirements align precisely with the business goals and objectives. Undertaking this process is instrumental in mitigating the potential risks associated with not meeting stakeholder expectations or inadvertently delivering an inaccurate solution.

## Core Concepts

1. **Validation vs. Verification**:

   - **Validation** revolves around confirming that all the requirements and related product information genuinely represent the intentions of the stakeholders. It ensures the right solution is in development. The primary purpose is to ascertain that the solution will indeed cater to and support the business objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs). A potential consequence of neglecting validation is that the devised solution may fail to align with the business's objectives and needs, often because these needs were misunderstood.

   - **Verification**, on the other hand, focuses on affirming that the product information adheres to specific standards and is articulately composed.

2. **Levels of Validation**:

   - Validation is versatile and can be applied across different organizational strata, such as the portfolio, program, or project stages.

3. **Iterative Validation**:

   - The validation process isn't always linear. It can be iterative, where specific requirements are periodically reassessed and validated. Alternatively, it can also be a cumulative process where a final batch of information is validated all at once.

   - Business objectives and goals are dynamic. As they evolve, it might necessitate corresponding adjustments to the requirements. These modified requirements will again need validation to ensure alignment with the changed business objectives.

4. **Scope of Validation**:

   - The validation process is versatile. It can be applied to individual requirements, singular models, or an entire set of product information.

   - Both requirements and the connected requirement models undergo verification and validation.

5. **Business Analyst's Role**:

   - A business analyst can independently conduct certain facets of the requirements validation using suitable analytical models. At this juncture, the validation is majorly centered on mapping the requirements and other product data to the business objectives. This exercise helps in pinpointing gaps, duplications, or inconsistencies.

6. **Stakeholder Involvement**:

   - The bulk of the validation process calls for active stakeholder involvement. Stakeholders are tasked with reviewing the requirements and associated product details. Their feedback determines if the presented information is robust enough to facilitate the construction of the desired solution.

   - The iterative nature of validation might also lead to the discovery of new elements that require attention. This discovery can subsequently trigger further stages like elicitation, modeling, analysis, and elaboration.

In essence, the Validate Requirements process serves as a crucial checkpoint in the business analysis domain. It ensures that the developing solution is in harmony with the business's aspirations, thus ensuring the solution's eventual success and acceptance among stakeholders.

## Validate Requirements:

## Inputs

### [Acceptance Criteria](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/acceptance-criteria.md)

Acceptance criteria provide clear definitions on the conditions that must be met for a product, feature, or solution to be considered complete. They act as benchmarks for validation, ensuring that the solution meets the intended business goals and objectives.

### [Analysis Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/analysis-approach.md)

The analysis approach outlines the methods and techniques used in the business analysis process. It defines how requirements will be elicited, documented, and communicated within the project, ensuring a consistent and structured approach.

### [Business Goals and Objectives](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/business-goals-and-objectives.md)

Business goals and objectives provide a clear direction for the project. They establish the desired outcomes and set the standard for what the solution must achieve to be deemed successful.

### [Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/requirements-and-other-product-information.md)

This refers to the detailed documentation of requirements and other related information about the product. It serves as a primary reference point for validation, ensuring that the developed solution aligns with the documented requirements.

## Tools and Techniques

### [Delphi](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/delphi.md)

The Delphi technique is a structured communication method used to obtain expert opinions and consensus. In the context of validating requirements, it involves multiple rounds of anonymous feedback from experts to converge on a consensus regarding the requirements.

### [Goal Model and Business Objectives Model](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/goal-model-and-business-objectives-model.md)

These models visualize the alignment between the business goals and the requirements. They ensure that the requirements are in line with the organization's objectives and support the achievement of the business goals.

### [Traceability Matrix](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/traceability-matrix.md)

A traceability matrix tracks the relationship between requirements and their sources. It ensures that each requirement can be traced back to a business goal or objective, confirming its relevance and importance.

### [Walkthroughs](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/walkthroughs.md)

Walkthroughs involve stepping through the requirements with stakeholders, providing them with an opportunity to review, understand, and provide feedback. This process ensures that the requirements are accurate, complete, and understood by all involved parties.

## Outputs

### [Validated Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/validated-requirements-and-other-product-information.md)

Once the requirements have undergone the validation process, they are deemed validated. These requirements are then considered reliable and accurate, ensuring that they fulfill the business's goals and objectives when implemented.

B: Pre-review allows stakeholders to come to the meeting with a foundational understanding, ensuring well-considered feedback and minimizing emotional reactions.
C: Pre-review is irrelevant and does not offer any benefits.
D: The only benefit is to reduce the workload of the business analyst.
Answer: B
Explanation: Pre-review of materials before a Walkthrough offers several benefits. It allows stakeholders to review the requirements or user stories in advance, leading to well-considered feedback. It also minimizes emotional reactions during the session, as stakeholders have time to ponder the solutions proposed, and it enables them to discuss the materials with their organizational units and peers for broader representation.

Question: During a Walkthrough session, who should drive the flow of information?
A: The flow of information should always be driven by the business analyst.
B: The flow of information should be driven by the reviewers, not just the business analyst, allowing stakeholders to raise questions and express concerns.
C: Only senior management should drive the flow of information.
D: The session should not have any structured flow of information.
Answer: B
Explanation: During a Walkthrough session, the flow of information should ideally be driven by the reviewers, which includes the stakeholders present. This approach allows stakeholders to actively participate by raising questions, seeking clarifications, and expressing concerns, thereby facilitating a thorough review and discussion of the materials.

Question: What is the importance of Requirements Walkthroughs in the validation process?
A: They are important for entertaining stakeholders.
