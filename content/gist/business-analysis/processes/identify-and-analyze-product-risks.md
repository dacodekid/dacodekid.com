# Identify and Analyze Product Risks

## Definition

The process of Identifying and Analyzing Product Risks is centered on discovering and studying assumptions and uncertainties that might either positively or negatively influence the success of the solution's definition, its development, and the anticipated results.

## Benefits

This process offers two primary advantages:

1. It encourages the proactive management of uncertainties in business analysis activities.
2. It helps in detecting and preemptively addressing the potential strong and weak points of the product.

## Relation with Business Analysis

Business analysis aids the processes of portfolio, program, or project risk management by pinpointing and analyzing risks that affect either the business analysis tasks or the product. These are termed as product risks. When product risks that have a detrimental effect aren't tackled, they can result in product failures.

## Activities Involved

1. **Identifying Product Risks**: This involves pinpointing risks and documenting their traits that might influence the business analysis tasks or the product.

2. **Performing Qualitative Risk Analysis**: Here, product risks are prioritized for in-depth analysis or action by evaluating and taking into account their likelihood and consequences.

3. **Performing Quantitative Risk Analysis**: This involves analyzing numerically the impact of pinpointed product risks on business goals.

4. **Planning Risk Responses**: This stage revolves around crafting options and actions to tackle product risks. Responses might involve alterations or the identification of additional product requisites, or even more project tasks, to capitalize on opportunities or deal with potential points of failure.

5. **Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats**:

   - **Avoid**: Completely eliminate the threat.
   - **Transfer**: Pass on the impact of the threat to another party.
   - **Mitigate**: Diminish the likelihood or consequence of the threat.
   - **Accept**: Recognize the threat but refrain from any action unless the risk transpires.

6. **Strategies for Positive Risks or Opportunities**:

   - **Exploit**: Guarantee that the opportunity comes to fruition.
   - **Enhance**: Boost the likelihood or positive outcomes of the opportunity.
   - **Share**: Assign all or part of the opportunity's ownership to another entity.
   - **Accept**: Capitalize on the opportunity if it emerges but don't actively chase it.

7. **Implementing Risk Responses**: This is about putting into action the agreed-upon risk responses.

8. **Monitoring Risks**: This involves supervising the execution of agreed-upon risk responses, keeping track of identified product risks, overseeing residual risks, recognizing new risks, and gauging the efficacy of the risk process.

## Considerations during the process

- **Assumptions**: These are elements deemed true or certain without tangible evidence. Every assumption carries a risk. This risk corresponds to what would happen if the assumption proves incorrect.

- **Constraints**: These are factors that restrict the operation of a portfolio, program, project, or process. In the realm of business analysis, constraints are factors that hamper the creation or execution of a solution. Risks may be identified if these constraints are breached.

- **Dependencies**: These are logical links between two or more entities. Risks may be identified if these dependencies aren't fulfilled.

- **Issues**: These are unsettled points or matters that are under discussion or in dispute. A risk might transform into an issue if the risk event happens and the response plan isn't up to the mark. Conversely, unresolved issues might give birth to new risks.

Transforming assumptions, constraints, dependencies, or yet-to-be-resolved issues into risks enables product teams to manage these elements more proactively. This is because risks typically undergo analysis at more regular intervals.

Question: What is the primary purpose of Bottom-Up Estimating in project management and business analysis?
A: To provide a detailed financial analysis of the project
B: To estimate the duration or cost of a project by breaking it down into smaller tasks and aggregating these estimates
C: To serve as a legal document outlining the project's scope
D: To focus exclusively on the technical details of a project
Answer: B
Explanation: The primary purpose of Bottom-Up Estimating in project management and business analysis is to estimate the duration or cost of a project by first breaking it down into smaller, constituent tasks or components. Each of these tasks is estimated individually in terms of duration, resources, or cost, and then these estimates are aggregated to provide a total estimate for the project or larger work package.

Question: How does Decomposition play a role in Bottom-Up Estimating?
A: It provides a financial breakdown of the project.
B: It involves breaking down the project into smaller, individual tasks or components for detailed estimation.
C: It focuses on the legal aspects of project tasks.
D: It outlines the technical specifications for each task.
Answer: B
Explanation: In Bottom-Up Estimating, Decomposition is a crucial step that involves breaking down the larger work package or project scope into smaller, individual tasks or components. This is often done using decomposition models like Work Breakdown Structures (WBS). The decomposition allows for a more detailed and accurate estimation of each component.

Question: What is a key benefit of the Bottom-Up Estimating technique?
A: It provides a detailed financial plan for the project.
B: It offers high accuracy due to individual estimation of each task.
C: It serves as a legal validation of project tasks.

Answer: B
Explanation: A key benefit of the Bottom-Up Estimating technique is its high accuracy. This accuracy is achieved because each lower-level task is estimated individually, considering all the specific factors such as time, resources, and cost involved. This detailed approach minimizes the chances of overlooking any task-specific considerations.

Question: What is a limitation associated with Bottom-Up Estimating?
A: It provides only a high-level financial overview of the project.
B: It can be time-consuming due to its detailed nature.
C: It is limited to legal assessment of project tasks.
D: It only focuses on technical aspects of project estimation.

This anonymity helps ensure that the collective wisdom is not skewed by the opinions or influence of a dominant individual.

Question: What is the process followed in the Delphi technique?
A: A detailed financial planning process
B: An iterative process of questionnaire distribution, feedback collection, and consensus-building among experts
C: A legal assessment process
D: A technical evaluation process
Answer: B
Explanation: The process followed in the Delphi technique involves initiating with a questionnaire to experts, collecting feedback anonymously, summarizing and redistributing the responses for further comments, and repeating these steps in multiple rounds until a consensus is reached. This iterative process is designed to build a collective agreement among experts.

Question: What kind of decisions can benefit from the application of the Delphi technique?
A: Financial investment decisions

B: A financial scale, focusing on the cost of each task
C: A legal scale, assessing the compliance requirements of each task
D: A technical complexity scale, specific to software development tasks
Answer: A
Explanation: In Estimation Poker, the Fibonacci series is a commonly used scale for estimation. Team members use cards that correspond to this scale to represent their estimate of the relative effort required to complete a task. This scale is chosen for its intuitive representation of relative sizing.

Question: In what scenarios outside of software development can Estimation Poker be effectively used?
A: In detailed financial planning
B: In various project management scenarios where tasks need to be estimated
