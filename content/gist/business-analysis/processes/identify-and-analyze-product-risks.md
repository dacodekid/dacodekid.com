## Identify and Analyze Product Risks

### Definition

The process of Identifying and Analyzing Product Risks is centered on discovering and studying assumptions and uncertainties that might either positively or negatively influence the success of the solution's definition, its development, and the anticipated results.

### Benefits

This process offers two primary advantages:

1. It encourages the proactive management of uncertainties in business analysis activities.
2. It helps in detecting and preemptively addressing the potential strong and weak points of the product.

### Relation with Business Analysis

Business analysis aids the processes of portfolio, program, or project risk management by pinpointing and analyzing risks that affect either the business analysis tasks or the product. These are termed as product risks. When product risks that have a detrimental effect aren't tackled, they can result in product failures.

### Activities Involved

1. **Identifying Product Risks**: This involves pinpointing risks and documenting their traits that might influence the business analysis tasks or the product.

2. **Performing Qualitative Risk Analysis**: Here, product risks are prioritized for in-depth analysis or action by evaluating and taking into account their likelihood and consequences.

3. **Performing Quantitative Risk Analysis**: This involves analyzing numerically the impact of pinpointed product risks on business goals.

4. **Planning Risk Responses**: This stage revolves around crafting options and actions to tackle product risks. Responses might involve alterations or the identification of additional product requisites, or even more project tasks, to capitalize on opportunities or deal with potential points of failure.

5. **Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats**:

   - **Avoid**: Completely eliminate the threat.
   - **Transfer**: Pass on the impact of the threat to another party.
   - **Mitigate**: Diminish the likelihood or consequence of the threat.
   - **Accept**: Recognize the threat but refrain from any action unless the risk transpires.

6. **Strategies for Positive Risks or Opportunities**:

   - **Exploit**: Guarantee that the opportunity comes to fruition.
   - **Enhance**: Boost the likelihood or positive outcomes of the opportunity.
   - **Share**: Assign all or part of the opportunity's ownership to another entity.
   - **Accept**: Capitalize on the opportunity if it emerges but don't actively chase it.

7. **Implementing Risk Responses**: This is about putting into action the agreed-upon risk responses.

8. **Monitoring Risks**: This involves supervising the execution of agreed-upon risk responses, keeping track of identified product risks, overseeing residual risks, recognizing new risks, and gauging the efficacy of the risk process.

### Considerations during the process

- **Assumptions**: These are elements deemed true or certain without tangible evidence. Every assumption carries a risk. This risk corresponds to what would happen if the assumption proves incorrect.

- **Constraints**: These are factors that restrict the operation of a portfolio, program, project, or process. In the realm of business analysis, constraints are factors that hamper the creation or execution of a solution. Risks may be identified if these constraints are breached.

- **Dependencies**: These are logical links between two or more entities. Risks may be identified if these dependencies aren't fulfilled.

- **Issues**: These are unsettled points or matters that are under discussion or in dispute. A risk might transform into an issue if the risk event happens and the response plan isn't up to the mark. Conversely, unresolved issues might give birth to new risks.

Transforming assumptions, constraints, dependencies, or yet-to-be-resolved issues into risks enables product teams to manage these elements more proactively. This is because risks typically undergo analysis at more regular intervals.

### Inputs

#### [Analysis Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

The Analysis Approach provides a structured way of understanding how the analysis will be conducted for a specific initiative or project. It encompasses the techniques, methods, and processes that will be employed to identify and manage requirements.

#### [Business Goals And Objectives](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Business Goals and Objectives provide a clear understanding of the desired outcomes of a project or initiative. They serve as a compass for the business analysis activities, ensuring alignment with the strategic direction of the organization.

#### [Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Enterprise Environmental Factors refer to the conditions, not under the direct control of the team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. EEFs can be internal to the organization, such as culture and infrastructure, or external, such as market conditions and regulations.

#### [Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Product Scope outlines the boundaries and characteristics of the product, service, or result. It provides clarity on what is included and excluded from the product, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations and business objectives.

#### [Requirements And Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

This encompasses the documented conditions and capabilities that a particular product or solution must have. These requirements provide a foundation for designing, building, and validating the solution.

### Tools And Techniques

#### [Context Diagram](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

A Context Diagram visually depicts the product scope, showing the product, its interfaces, and the entities that interact with it. It's a high-level representation that provides a quick overview of system interactions.

#### [Ecosystem Map](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

The Ecosystem Map provides a visual representation of the various entities and their interrelationships within a particular environment. It's instrumental in understanding the broader system in which a solution will operate.

#### [Elicitation Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Elicitation Techniques are methods employed to gather information from stakeholders. They are crucial for uncovering requirements, risks, assumptions, and constraints.

#### [Estimation Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

These techniques assist in predicting the most realistic amount of work required to complete a task or project. Estimations can be in terms of time, cost, or resources.

#### [Organizational Chart](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

An Organizational Chart represents the structure of an organization. It helps in understanding roles, responsibilities, and the hierarchy within the organization.

#### [Process Flows](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Process Flows visually represent the steps, events, and sequence of a particular process. They are crucial for understanding how different tasks are interconnected.

#### [Product Backlog](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

A Product Backlog is a prioritized list of features, enhancements, and fixes for a product. It serves as a central repository for requirements in agile environments.

#### [Risk Burndown Chart](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

This chart visualizes the amount of risk remaining over time. It helps teams monitor and manage risks throughout the lifecycle of a project.

#### [Risk Register](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

The Risk Register is a documented list of identified risks, their characteristics, and actions. It is a dynamic tool that evolves as risks are identified, mitigated, or materialized.

#### [Root Cause And Opportunity Analysis](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

This analysis delves deep into problems to identify their fundamental causes. It aids in addressing the underlying issues rather than just their symptoms.
