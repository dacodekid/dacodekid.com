# Establish Relationships and Dependencies

Establishing Relationships and Dependencies is vital for creating a clear pathway between different requirements and product information. This process aids in ensuring that the product scope remains accurate and all components are interlinked effectively.

### Progressive Elaboration

As details of the product become more refined over time, relationships and dependencies evolve as well. This progressive elaboration helps in creating a detailed and interconnected network of information.

### Significance of Linkages

Creating linkages among various components of product information serves multiple purposes:

1. **Relevancy**: By tracing every piece of product information to its associated business need, goals, and objectives, you can ensure that it remains relevant and meets the intended purpose.

2. **Scope Management**: A clear way to identify non-value-adding elements is by highlighting product information that doesn't trace back to the product scope or the business's goals and objectives.

3. **Ensuring Completeness**: Forward traceability is vital. It ensures that as product details are expanded upon and moved through different stages (like building, testing, and implementation), no essential information is missed or omitted.

4. **Impact Analysis**: When modifications are proposed or implemented, these linkages provide a full perspective on the associated components that might also need adjustments. This understanding makes change management smoother.

5. **Release Decisions**: The interconnections and dependencies among product information play a pivotal role in making informed decisions regarding releases. By understanding how different elements relate, and the value or benefits they bring, one can make more strategic choices about what to implement or release at specific times.

The process of establishing relationships and dependencies is paramount for maintaining a coherent and effective product scope. It ensures that every component of product information aligns with the business goals, is relevant, and that potential changes are managed efficiently.

### Inputs

#### [Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Product scope provides a high-level overview of the product's features, functionalities, and boundaries. It sets the parameters within which the requirements will be defined, elaborated, and validated.

#### [Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

This includes all the gathered and defined requirements, specifications, user stories, or any other product information that has been accumulated throughout the business analysis process. Having a comprehensive understanding of these elements is pivotal when establishing relationships and identifying dependencies.

#### [Traceability and Monitoring Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

This approach defines how requirements will be traced back to their origin and how they will be monitored over the course of the project. It aids in understanding the lineage of requirements and ensures alignment with business goals and objectives.

### Tools and Techniques

#### [Feature Model](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

A feature model is a visual representation used to showcase the set of products or features within a product line, indicating their relationships and dependencies. By using this model, business analysts can identify how different features correlate and affect one another.

#### [Requirements Management Tool](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

This tool assists in the organization, storage, and management of requirements. It can help in identifying relationships between various requirements, thus ensuring that all dependencies are accurately recognized and managed.

#### [Story Mapping](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Story mapping is a visual representation technique used to prioritize user stories by mapping them out in sequences. This allows stakeholders and the development team to get a clearer understanding of the project's big picture and how each story relates to the others.

#### [Story Slicing](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

This technique involves breaking down user stories into smaller, more manageable parts. By doing this, it becomes easier to identify relationships and dependencies between different slices of a larger story.

#### [Traceability Matrix](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

A traceability matrix is a document that maps and traces the relationship between requirements and their sources. It aids in understanding the origin of each requirement, ensuring that they align with business goals, and detecting any dependencies.

### Outputs

#### [Relationships and Dependencies](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

This output captures the identified relationships and dependencies among requirements, features, and other elements of the product. It provides a structured view that helps in decision-making, prioritization, and ensuring that the product's components are developed in a sequence that respects their interdependencies.
