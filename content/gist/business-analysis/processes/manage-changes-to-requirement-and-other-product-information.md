## Manage Changes to requirement and other product information

Managing changes to requirements and product information is an essential process in business analysis. It ensures that any modifications or defects arising during a project are scrutinized for their value and potential impact. This process ensures that only valuable changes, which support prioritization and subsequent product development, are integrated. This facilitates the addition of vital solution modifications while also curbing unnecessary alterations. By doing so, the stakeholders gain a clearer understanding of the effects of the changes on the final product.

When managing changes, the primary aim is to preserve the integrity of the requirements, associated deliverables, and work products. Moreover, it is crucial that any new requirements correspond with the initial business objectives and needs. By having a systematic process for requirements change, we can effectively manage changes to previously approved requirements. This minimizes the risks associated with unchecked or unauthorized alterations. A common pitfall in projects is making changes without assessing their repercussions, particularly in terms of dependencies. Such oversights can negatively affect the overall project and anticipated business value.

The nature of the project, be it adaptive or predictive, can influence the change management process:

- **Adaptive Projects**: In these projects, changes are continuous. Here, stakeholders refine their requirements as different parts of the solution are presented sequentially. Since adaptive methodologies anticipate changes in requirements based on stakeholder feedback, a ranking system is utilized to decide the importance and timing of a proposed change.

- **Predictive Projects**: For these projects, a change refers to any alteration proposed post the finalization (or baselining) of requirements. Even though changes can be proposed at any stage, they are generally more challenging and costlier to implement in a predictive framework. A governing body usually evaluates these changes for their impact on ongoing tasks and previously approved requirements. A change is more probable to get the green light if its value outweighs the associated costs and resource implications.

Once a proposed change is assessed, there are four potential outcomes:

1. **Change Approved**: Necessary revisions are made to the affected business analysis documents. Any ongoing or planned business analysis tasks are recalibrated to accommodate this change. In adaptive projects, the concept of 'approval' is replaced by simply adding the proposed change to the product backlog.

2. **Change Deferred**: The choice to postpone a change is recorded with an accompanying explanation. If a tentative date for considering the change in a future product release is given, it's marked in the relevant plans. In adaptive methodologies, this equates to assigning a lower priority to the proposed change in the product backlog.

3. **Change Rejected**: The decision to dismiss a change is recorded with its respective rationale. No reminders for future consideration are set, indicating that the proposed work won't be pursued. For adaptive projects, this translates to either not adding or removing an item from the product backlog.

4. **More Information Required**: Sometimes, the impact assessment might not be exhaustive, prompting the Change Control Board (CCB) or the approving team to seek additional details. This necessitates another round of data gathering and analysis, followed by an updated impact assessment and another review by the decision-making entity. In adaptive projects, items in the backlog are detailed sufficiently for prioritization, and if chosen, they are further expanded upon to gather details essential for development. The need for more details for a change is expected as this elaboration is integral to the methodology.

Finally, the intensity of change management implemented hinges on various factors like the domain of application, organizational culture, available organizational process assets, project complexity, contractual stipulations, the project lifecycle, and the environment in which the project operates. The level of formality and the extent of documentation needed for managing changes are determined by organizational protocols, processes, or external mandates.

### Inputs

#### [Approved Requirements](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

The Approved Requirements are a set of documented needs and expectations that have been formally agreed upon by stakeholders. These serve as the basis for further development, testing, and implementation, ensuring that the project stays aligned with its original objectives and stakeholder expectations.

#### [Business Goals and Objectives](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

These are the overarching aims that the organization seeks to achieve, guiding the direction of any project or initiative. Understanding these ensures that the requirements being managed are in line with the broader organizational context and strategy.

#### [Change Requests](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Change Requests are formal proposals to modify a product or system. These can arise due to various reasons such as changing business needs, feedback from stakeholders, or unforeseen challenges in implementation.

#### [Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Product Scope defines the boundaries and features of a product or solution. It provides clarity on what is included and what is out of scope, serving as a reference point when assessing the implications of potential changes.

#### [Relationships and Dependencies](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Understanding the interconnections and reliance between different requirements, systems, or processes is essential. This insight ensures that when a change is made, its cascading effects are thoroughly considered.

#### [Traceability and Monitoring Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

This approach outlines how requirements will be tracked throughout their lifecycle, ensuring that changes are adequately monitored, logged, and communicated to relevant stakeholders.

### Tools and Techniques

#### [Backlog Management](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Backlog Management involves prioritizing and organizing pending tasks, requirements, or issues. In the context of changes, it helps in assessing the importance of each change and its alignment with current tasks.

#### [Change Control Tools](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

These tools provide structured processes and methods to request, assess, approve, and implement changes in a project, ensuring that modifications are controlled and well-documented.

#### [Group Decision-Making Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

When faced with changes, collective decision-making can be beneficial. These techniques encourage multiple perspectives and consensus-driven solutions to address the implications of changes.

#### [Impact Analysis](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Impact Analysis assesses the consequences of a proposed change, helping stakeholders understand the potential ramifications on the project, timeline, costs, or other requirements.

#### [Requirements Management Tool](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

These tools provide a centralized platform to document, track, and manage requirements. They are particularly valuable in environments where changes are frequent, ensuring traceability and effective communication.

#### [Traceability Matrix](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

A Traceability Matrix maps requirements to their source or origin. This tool ensures that each requirement can be tracked back to its root cause or need, proving invaluable when managing changes.

### Outputs

#### [Recommended Changes to Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Post the change management process, there will be a set of advised modifications to the existing requirements or product details. These recommendations are based on thorough analysis and stakeholder consensus and are geared towards enhancing the product's value or aligning it better with business goals.
