# Prepare Transition to Future State

The process of "Prepare for Transition to Future State" focuses on determining the readiness of an organization to transition from its current state to a new future state. This transition integrates the solution or a component of the solution into the daily operations of the organization. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the organization can embrace the changes arising from the solution's implementation and that any benefits from the solution can be sustained once it's operational.

## Key Points

1. **Benefits**:

   - Ensures that the organization effectively adopts the changes from the new solution.
   - Ensures anticipated benefits from the solution can be sustained post-implementation.

2. **Transition Readiness Assessment**:

   - Evaluates an organization's capability and willingness to operate within the future state.
   - Identifies readiness gaps, which are seen as risks to achieving the desired end state.
   - Incorporates results from an organizational readiness assessment, considering influences of the organization's EEFs (Environmental Enterprise Factors) and OPA (Organizational Process Assets).
   - An organization's readiness can be compared against a maturity model or against similar organizations for insights into competitive opportunities or challenges.

3. **Transition Requirements**:

   - These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and training requirements.
   - They also detail operational changes required to move from the current to the future state.
   - Such requirements can emerge from modeling, defining product requirements, or feasibility analysis.

4. **Transition Strategies**:

   - **Massive One-time Cutover**: Direct transition to the future state all at once.
   - **Staged Release**: Gradual release of the future state based on target segments, like region or type of customer.
   - **Time-boxed Coexistence**: Both current and future states coexist for a set period before a final cutover.
   - **Permanent Coexistence**: Both states continue to coexist indefinitely.

5. **Transition Plan**:

   - Created collaboratively with all roles responsible for the transition.
   - Addresses all transition requirements, including communication, rollout, training, and updates to procedures.
   - Is coordinated with other releases that contribute to the future state.
   - Ensures the business can handle changes, including interruptions caused by the transition.
   - Can be adjusted to cater to emerging transition requirements or readiness deficiencies.

6. **Considerations for Successful Transition**:

   - Ensure the solution delivers expected capabilities.
   - Prepare users for the change.
   - Operational environments may need setup or conversion, especially for complex products or large user bases.
   - A well-considered and executed transition plan is vital for success.

7. **Organizational Approaches**:
   - Large organizations with predictive life cycles often have a structured approach to transitions.
   - Whether using predictive or adaptive life cycles, rigor, discipline, and sometimes automation are crucial for a smooth transition.
   - Transition plans should ideally be considered early in a product's life cycle.

In summary, preparing for a transition to the future state is a meticulous process that demands thorough planning and collaboration. It's about assessing and ensuring that an organization is not only ready to adopt a new solution but also capable of sustaining its benefits in the long run. Whether through a one-time cutover or a staged approach, the transition must be managed with precision to ensure long-term success.
