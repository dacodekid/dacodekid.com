# Determine Solution Evaluation Approach

The Determine Solution Evaluation Approach is a pivotal process which focuses on identifying the various facets of an organization or solution that need to be evaluated. This process primarily centers on how performance will be gauged, the frequency of such evaluations, the timeline of these evaluations, and the individuals responsible for conducting them.

A significant advantage of this process is its ability to select or devise appropriate performance indicators and metrics. These metrics can then be systematically gathered, reported, and reviewed to enhance the organization and/or product continually.

The approach for Solution Evaluation requires a combination of thorough research, meaningful discussions, and in-depth analysis. The primary objective is to discern the optimal ways and timelines to assess a product. The key components that should be considered when determining the solution evaluation approach include:

- **Frequency of Evaluation:** It's essential to strategize when and how often the solution evaluation activities will be executed. This evaluation can be integrated at various stages such as during the solution's development, immediately before its release, shortly after its launch, or even a considerable time post-launch.

- **Selection of Techniques:** It's not mandatory to finalize all evaluation techniques at the onset. However, a proactive approach ensures that business analysts are equipped and ready to employ a diverse range of techniques as and when required.

- **Analysis and Reporting:** Deliberate planning is needed for how the outcomes of the evaluation will be scrutinized and presented.

- **Communication Strategy:** It's crucial to devise a communication strategy for updating stakeholders and other interested entities about the progress of the solution evaluation. This includes deciding on the degree of formality for such communications.

- **Metrics Selection:** Deciding on the specific metrics that will assess performance is crucial. These metrics should ideally align with the overarching business goals and objectives.

Metrics play a central role in this process. They are essentially sets of quantifiable measures designed to evaluate various aspects of a solution or business. Within the domain of solution evaluation, metrics furnish a framework to measure solution performance. A multitude of metrics can be employed to gauge tangible attributes of the solution, such as its throughput, productivity, or efficiency.

Typically, there are two prevalent categories of metrics delineated by the solution evaluation approach:

1. **Acceptance Metrics:** These metrics are employed to evaluate the solution or its individual components for acceptance during its developmental phase or shortly after. These metrics work within the confines of pre-defined acceptance criteria that establish permissible ranges.

2. **Value Metrics:** These metrics are typically deployed at a later stage to discern if the anticipated business value has been realized. Since the assessment of solution performance is delayed till post-release, there's a possibility that the selected metrics or their measurement methodology might evolve.

For an effective solution evaluation approach, teams should deliberate on several key aspects regarding metrics:

- The specific performance data needed for the metrics, its collection frequency, and methodology.
- The individuals or teams accountable for amassing and presenting this performance data.

- Existing mechanisms for data collection and reporting for these metrics. If absent, identification of additional required capabilities and the associated financial implications.

The foundational knowledge about the problem or opportunity the solution intends to address and the defined product scope can guide the selection of suitable metrics. Existing industry or organizational standards might offer benchmarks to juxtapose the solution against general expectations.

It's paramount to define the solution evaluation approach early in the product development life cycle. An early definition can preempt potential challenges, especially concerning metrics that might need additional data beyond the product's innate requirements. Delayed definitions could lead to escalated costs or the infeasibility of data acquisition. In cases where proposed metrics prove to be exorbitantly costly or time-intensive, more cost-effective alternatives might be explored.

## Inputs

### [Metrics and KPIs](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/metrics-and-kpis.md)

Metrics and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are quantifiable measures used to evaluate and track the success or performance of specific business processes or goals. They provide a means to measure how effectively the organization is achieving its key business objectives.

### [Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/product-scope.md)

The product scope outlines the boundaries and the extent of what the product will and will not deliver. It serves as a baseline for understanding the features, functionalities, and requirements that the product must satisfy to meet stakeholders' needs and expectations.

### [Situation Statement](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/situation-statement.md)

A situation statement provides a concise description of an issue, problem, or opportunity that needs addressing. It serves as a foundational piece to clarify the context and guide the subsequent analysis and solution development.

## Tools and Techniques

### [Elicitation Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/elicitation-techniques.md)

Elicitation techniques are methods used to gather information from stakeholders. These techniques can range from interviews, surveys, and workshops to observations and brainstorming sessions. The goal is to gather detailed, relevant, and accurate information to inform the business analysis process.

### [Group Decision-Making Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/group-decision-making-techniques.md)

Group decision-making techniques involve multiple individuals in the decision-making process. Techniques such as brainstorming, Delphi method, and consensus-building are used to gather diverse perspectives and arrive at a well-informed decision.

### [Prioritization Schemes](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/prioritization-schemes.md)

Prioritization schemes are systematic approaches to rank requirements, features, or other items based on their value, risk, cost, or other criteria. They ensure that the most critical items are addressed first, optimizing the delivery of value.

### [Retrospectives and Lessons Learned](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/retrospectives-and-lessons-learned.md)

Retrospectives and lessons learned sessions are structured reviews that teams undertake to reflect on their experiences. These reviews help identify what went well, what challenges were faced, and what improvements can be made in the future.

## Outputs

### [Solution Evaluation Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/solution-evaluation-approach.md)

The solution evaluation approach outlines the methods and criteria to assess the performance and effectiveness of a solution once implemented. This approach ensures that the solution aligns with business objectives and meets stakeholders' needs and expectations.
