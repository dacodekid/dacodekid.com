# Create and Analyze Models

Create and Analyze Models is a process that centers on crafting structured representations of product information. These representations can be diagrams, tables, or structured text. One of the primary advantages of this process is the ability to convey information in a structured, clear manner, ensuring both correctness and completeness.

## Purpose of Models

- Models serve as visual representations, efficiently organizing and conveying vast amounts of information.

- This process encompasses both the creation of analysis models, as determined by the analysis approach, and utilizing those models to enhance overall product information.

- Analyzing models is instrumental for identifying information gaps and extraneous details by viewing the solution from multiple angles.

- Models offer context for discussions, promoting a better grasp of intricate relationships and ideas. Frequently, they provide a clearer picture compared to text-only descriptions.

- They offer a succinct means of presenting data and can clarify and unearth information in discussions with stakeholders.

- Analysis of models involves examining specific data sections, rather than the entirety of the information, to discern patterns that warrant further exploration in the problem space.

## Process Interaction

- When paired with elicitation, the activities of creating and analyzing models can be individual or collaborative.

- These tasks are notably iterative, with initial model drafts stemming from confirmed elicitation outcomes. Subsequently, these models might cycle through elicitation sessions again to pinpoint and refine newly identified information.

- This process often runs in tandem with other sections like Verify Requirements and Validate Requirements.

## Significance

Models are pivotal for a plethora of business analysis activities beyond just the Create and Analyze Models process. They play a role in:

- Refining and elucidating requirements.
- Fostering a collective comprehension of the information.
- Charting relationships and dependencies spanning portfolios, programs, and projects.
- Detecting information voids demanding further elicitation.
- Recognizing stakeholders that might have been overlooked.
- Enhancing stakeholder comprehension during elicitation or review phases.
- Appraising capability discrepancies between a product's current and anticipated states.
- Analyzing alterations to pinpoint affected product areas.
- Discerning user value points.
- Ranking product information or projects in a portfolio hierarchy.
- Estimating the scope of business analysis tasks.
- Offering a business-centric view on architectural blueprints.

These aforementioned activities could necessitate modifications to present models or the formulation of new ones.

## Classification

Models are segmented into five distinct categories:

1. **Scope Models**: They delineate the solution's boundaries.
2. **Process Models**: Detail how the solution will be implemented.
3. **Rule Models**: Enlist the regulations the solution has to adhere to.
4. **Data Models**: Capture the data involved in a system or process, along with its lifecycle.
5. **Interface Models**: Illustrate how the solution interfaces with other systems and its users.

Through the examination of solutions via these five model categories, a business analyst can acquire a holistic view of the product.
