## Conduct Business Analysis Planning

Conduct Business Analysis Planning refers to the process carried out to reach a mutual agreement concerning the business analysis activities that will be executed by the team. This process also involves deciding on the roles, responsibilities, and necessary skill sets for tasks essential to the successful completion of the business analysis work.

The outcome of this process culminates in a business analysis plan. This plan can either be formally documented and approved or less structured, depending on the team's modus operandi. Regardless of the documentation style, the outcomes from all planning processes should be taken into account in the overarching strategy. Not making planning decisions can potentially lead to suboptimal results during business analysis. A major advantage of this process is the establishment of expectations, which is done by promoting discussions and consensus on the execution of business analysis. This ensures there is no ambiguity concerning roles and responsibilities when tasks are being executed.

### Objectives

1. **Integration of Knowledge Areas:** The process combines all Knowledge Area methods into a unified set of agreements and decisions about the conduct of business analysis.

2. **Estimation of Effort:** It generates an estimate of the effort required for various business analysis activities.

3. **Assembly of Business Analysis Plan:** The plan is pieced together from the individual approaches and the provided estimates.

The execution of activities linked to these objectives differs significantly depending on whether a plan-driven, predictive life cycle or a change-driven, adaptive life cycle is being used.

When formulating the business analysis plan, it's best practice to offer justifications for the planning decisions made. For instance, projects that follow an adaptive life cycle will have a distinct plan for the depth and frequency of analysis activities than those following a predictive life cycle. Offering reasons for planning decisions not only gives context to those assessing the plan but also rationalizes the choices made.

In a predictive life cycle, a plan-driven approach is often adopted for planning and estimation. Estimations are crafted for each role participating in a project, either for the whole project duration or for specific phases. The granularity of these estimates can vary. In the realm of business analysis, this means individual time estimates are generated for the expected effort for each specific business analysis task. After estimating the tasks, they're organized into a fitting work plan.

In contrast, teams that use a change-driven, adaptive life cycle still consider business analysis tasks, effort levels, task durations, dependencies, constraints, and task sequencing. However, usually, business analysis effort and tasks aren't segregated for estimation and planning.

For an adaptive life cycle method, during a planning session at the release level, prioritization often emerges as the key planning criterion. When planning starts at the outset of every iteration, both prioritization and just-in-time estimating determine the product backlog items the team will commit to. Post this, these items are split into tasks. Some adaptive approach teams also segregate and estimate time for refining significant or intricate items that are part of the current iteration or are up next in a product backlog but haven't been fully understood to kickstart development.

Despite the distinctions in approaches, business analysis planning remains an integral part of product development, regardless of the life cycle model adopted. The act of planning for business analysis must always transpire.

### Inputs

#### [Business Analysis Performance Assessment](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

The Business Analysis Performance Assessment evaluates the efficiency and effectiveness of business analysis practices within an organization. It includes reviewing past performance data, business analysis activities, and outcomes to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.

#### [Charter](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

The Charter, often referred to as a project charter, is a formal document that outlines the objectives, scope, and participants in a project. It serves as an authoritative guide for stakeholders, offering a clear direction and framework for the business analysis activities to follow.

#### [Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Enterprise Environmental Factors are conditions not within the immediate control of the team that influence, constrain, or direct the business analysis efforts. These can include organizational culture, market conditions, regulatory requirements, and various other external or internal factors.

#### [Planning Approaches from All Other Knowledge Areas](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

Planning Approaches from All Other Knowledge Areas refer to methodologies and strategies derived from diverse fields of knowledge within the business analysis context. They provide comprehensive insights and structured frameworks to guide the planning process effectively.

#### [Product Risk Analysis](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Product Risk Analysis involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks related to the product or project. This analysis helps in formulating mitigation strategies to manage potential threats and to ensure the project's success.

### Tools and Techniques

#### [Burndown Charts](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Burndown Charts are visual tools that display the amount of work remaining over time in a project. They are instrumental in tracking progress and forecasting completion dates, helping teams to manage workloads effectively.

#### [Decomposition Model](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

The Decomposition Model is a technique used to break down complex projects or processes into smaller, more manageable components. This hierarchical breakdown aids in understanding, analyzing, and planning the project more effectively.

#### [Estimation Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Estimation Techniques encompass various methods used to predict the most realistic amount of effort, cost, and time required to complete a project or a task. These techniques can range from expert judgment to complex statistical models.

#### [Planning Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Planning Techniques are systematic approaches used to outline how to execute, monitor, and control a project. These techniques ensure that business analysis activities align with the project goals and objectives and are conducted efficiently.

### Outputs

#### [Business Analysis Plan](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

The Business Analysis Plan is a formal document that outlines the activities, tasks, resources, and timelines for the business analysis efforts. It serves as a roadmap guiding stakeholders through the process and ensuring alignment with the project's goals and objectives.
