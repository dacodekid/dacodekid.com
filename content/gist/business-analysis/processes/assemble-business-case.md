# Assemble Business Case

Assemble Business Case is a process that emphasizes the consolidation of comprehensive research and analysis to endorse the optimal selection of portfolio components, programs, or projects which align with the business objectives. One of its prime advantages is that it allows consistent scrutiny of programs and projects, facilitating decision-makers in ascertaining the worthiness of an investment.

This process entails:

1. **Scope:** It encapsulates the work undertaken to amalgamate and present the requisite data to pivotal decision-makers for evaluating potential investments. This essentially determines if a certain initiative is worth the resources.

2. **Business Case Definition:** It's an economic feasibility document that validates the benefits expected from a proposed initiative. The case probes the problem or opportunity, establishes its core causes, and delves deep into various dimensions that lead to an exhaustive recommendation.

3. **Needs Assessment Utilization:** The in-depth analysis conducted during the Needs Assessment phase forms the foundation for creating the business case. This case provides the vital data needed to formulate objectives and serves as a crucial input for the charter. A significant aspect of this case is recognizing and lucidly conveying the expected value from the proposed change.

4. **Formality Variations:** Every business problem or opportunity doesn't mandate a formal business case. Some decisions might be influenced by factors like market competition, legal mandates, or executive discretion. In these scenarios, a charter might suffice. However, larger or strictly regulated entities typically necessitate both a formal business case and a charter.

5. **Decision Making Enhancement:** Business cases aid organizations in systematically evaluating and choosing the most advantageous investments. Adopting this process typically results in superior decision-making.

6. **Template Utilization:** Organizations may prefer a standardized template for business cases. These templates or software help in ensuring consistency across the process.

7. **Essential Components:** Every business case should at least encompass:

   - **Problem/Opportunity Statement:** Defines the impetus behind the action. It should articulate the business issue or prospect that necessitates a solution.

   - **Situational Analysis:** Describes how the solution aligns with business objectives. This should cover the root causes and back the analysis with relevant data.

   - **Recommendation:** Provides a feasibility analysis for each option, emphasizing constraints, risks, and assumptions. A ranking system for alternatives and a detailed cost-benefit analysis is also essential.

   - **Evaluation Plan:** Highlights a strategy for gauging benefits realization, which typically comprises metrics that assess how the solution caters to the business objectives.

8. **Living Document:** Post its creation, the business case serves as a continuous reference throughout the initiative's lifespan. Periodic reviews and updates might be needed, based on the evolving nature of the project.

9. **Driving Factors:** The urge to develop a business case can arise from varied sources such as market demand, technological advances, legal requisites, ecological concerns, and more.

10. **Reviews in Multiphase Initiatives:** For prolonged initiatives, it's imperative to frequently reassess the business case to ascertain that the project remains on the desired trajectory. These reviews ensure the initiative's alignment with the original business case.

11. **Adaptive vs. Predictive Lifecycle:** While both recognize the business case as pivotal, adaptive methods focus on collating "just enough" content to initiate, continually refining the solution. In contrast, predictive methods emphasize comprehensive upfront analysis.

Understanding the Assemble Business Case process is paramount as it forms the crux of decision-making in organizations, ensuring that resources are directed towards the most fruitful ventures.
