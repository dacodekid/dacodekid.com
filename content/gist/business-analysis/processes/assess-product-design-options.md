# Assess Product Design Options

Assess Product Design Options revolves around the process of scrutinizing, delving into, and comparing the variety of solution design alternatives. This comparison is grounded on several factors like the business's aspirations and aims, the anticipated costs linked with its implementation, its viability, the risks associated, and so forth. Post this rigorous assessment, recommendations pertaining to the design options in question are put forth. This procedure's paramount advantage is that it paves the way for well-informed suggestions concerning design choices.

## Deep Dive

Venturing into the realm of product design isn't merely confined to the functionalities of the product. Rather, it delves deeper into its construction methodology and its aesthetic attributes. When it comes to crafting a solution, there's a plethora of alternatives to pick from. The role of business analysis becomes pivotal here, as it assists in evaluating these myriad options. This involves discerning the gamut of design choices at one's disposal and meticulously analyzing how these designs metamorphose into a concrete solution. The analytical outcomes corresponding to each option furnishes crucial details that elucidate the advantages, disadvantages, associated risks, and the financial implications of that particular choice. Every design alternative is juxtaposed with its counterparts to deduce which among them is the most congruent with the overarching product goals, constraints, financial stipulations, and temporal boundaries. Non-feasible designs are promptly eliminated from the list of contenders.

## Design Deliberations

Initiating conversations around design is imperative prior to commencing the actual construction of a solution or even its components. This stands true irrespective of the magnitude of the solution fragment in question. Bypassing these vital deliberations could culminate in objectives being overlooked or in products that aren't user-friendly. Moreover, the development phase of the product might become prolonged if the teams are caught up in spontaneous design decision-making.

Product-centric teams aren't bound to defer their product design evaluations until the culmination of the requirements phase. This evaluative process can run parallelly as fragments of requirements crystallize into design. It's pivotal to rank these requirements hierarchically to ensure that the design resonates with the most pressing requirements. In scenarios where this procedure is executed in an iterative and incremental fashion, design paradigms might undergo alterations across iterations, triggering some modifications. In scenarios following adaptive life cycles, such modifications are factored in during the planning phase. On the contrary, in a predictive life cycle framework, the design undergoes changes post the completion of the requirements phase. As a consequence, these alterations exert a more pronounced impact, often escalating costs. Such ramifications are especially pronounced when they stem from insights garnered during the product's developmental trajectory.

## Design Scope

Design ideologies and analyses aren't confined solely to projects. They also permeate portfolios and programs. While designs attain their pinnacle of intricacy at the project level, serving as the bedrock for the solution's complete or partial realization, portfolios and programs also undergo design analysis. However, at these levels, the granularity is attuned just enough to guarantee uniformity across diverse solution releases or components.

## Inputs

### [Analysis Approach](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/analysis-approach.md)

The Analysis Approach provides the framework and guidelines for conducting product risk analysis, ensuring consistency and alignment with business goals and project objectives. It dictates the methodologies, techniques, and tools to be employed during the analysis process.

### [Business Goals and Objectives](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/business-goals-and-objectives.md)

Business Goals and Objectives serve as a reference point for identifying and analyzing product risks, ensuring that the analysis is tailored to support the achievement of these goals. They help in prioritizing risks based on their potential impact on business outcomes.

### [Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/enterprise-environmental-factors.md)

Enterprise Environmental Factors are conditions that influence the product risk analysis but are outside the control of the project team. These include organizational culture, market conditions, and regulatory requirements, among others, and must be considered during the analysis.

### [Product Scope](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/product-scope.md)

The Product Scope outlines the features, functions, and attributes of the product. Understanding the scope is crucial for identifying risks associated with product complexity, integration, and technological challenges.

### [Requirements and Other Product Information](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/requirements-and-other-product-information.md)

Requirements and Other Product Information provide a detailed understanding of stakeholder needs, product features, and functional and non-functional requirements. This information is vital for identifying risks related to requirement feasibility, clarity, and consistency.

## Tools and Techniques

### [Context Diagram](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/context-diagram.md)

A Context Diagram visually represents the product's interaction with external entities, highlighting potential areas of risk associated with external interfaces, dependencies, and data flows.

### [Ecosystem Map](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/ecosystem-map.md)

An Ecosystem Map provides a comprehensive view of the product's environment, including stakeholders, systems, and external factors. This holistic perspective aids in identifying risks that may arise from the broader ecosystem in which the product operates.

### [Elicitation Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/elicitation-techniques.md)

Elicitation Techniques are employed to gather information from stakeholders and subject matter experts regarding potential product risks. Techniques such as interviews, surveys, and workshops are instrumental in uncovering risks that may not be immediately apparent.

### [Estimation Techniques](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/estimation-techniques.md)

Estimation Techniques are used to assess the potential impact and probability of identified risks. Techniques like analogous estimation, parametric estimation, and three-point estimation provide quantitative data to support risk analysis.

### [Organizational Chart](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/organizational-chart.md)

An Organizational Chart helps in understanding the structure of the organization, roles, and responsibilities. It is useful in identifying risks related to governance, communication channels, and resource allocation.

### [Process Flows](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/process-flows.md)

Process Flows depict the sequence of activities involved in delivering the product. They are instrumental in identifying risks associated with process inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and integration points.

### [Product Backlog](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/product-backlog.md)

The Product Backlog contains a prioritized list of features and requirements. Analyzing the backlog helps in identifying risks related to scope creep, prioritization conflicts, and technical feasibility.

### [Risk Burndown Chart](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/burndown-charts.md)

A Risk Burndown Chart visually tracks the reduction of risk over time. It is a useful tool for monitoring the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies and for communicating risk status to stakeholders.

### [Risk Register](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/risk-register.md)
