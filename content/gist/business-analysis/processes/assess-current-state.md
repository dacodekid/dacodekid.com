## Assess Current State

The "Assess Current State" process aims to delve deep into the current environment being analyzed. The primary objective is to comprehend both internal and external factors that might be either the root cause or a driving factor for a specific problem or opportunity.

### Key Benefit

The main advantage of this process is to equip stakeholders with a thorough understanding of the present condition of the organization. This understanding is pivotal in determining the elements that will remain constant, versus those that require modification, thus painting a clearer picture of the desired future state.

### Areas of Analysis

The scope of analysis is vast, ranging from a specific project or a program to an entire department or business unit. Other potential areas of investigation include the competitive landscape, specific products, and many more. Factors to be inspected can be as intrinsic as organizational culture, processes, and structure or as extensive as external elements, enterprise architectures, capacities like human resources, and capital resources.

### Depth of Analysis

The information gathered during this process is often denser and more detailed than the initial data accumulated while identifying the problem or opportunity. The reason for this is the continuous elicitation activities that further nurture the available information. This process often goes hand-in-hand with the "Conduct Elicitation" section.

### Evaluation of Current Capabilities

One of the principal areas of concentration during the current state assessment is evaluating the organization's existing capabilities. Here, capability refers to the organization's proficiency, whether it's a service, process, or any other function. These capabilities act as the catalyst enabling the organization to realize its strategy. The root cause analysis of an issue lets the organization pinpoint the necessary capabilities or those needing further maturation to cater to the business needs. Any potential limitations and the respective root causes are also identified, and the required capabilities to address these are taken into account.

### Objective

The primary goal of the current state assessments isn't to dive deep into a comprehensive analysis of requirements. Instead, it's to gain ample knowledge about the problem or opportunity, ensuring that stakeholders have a robust grasp of the situation.

### Elicitation Methods

To obtain information regarding the current state, various elicitation techniques are employed. These methods range from scrutinizing documents, conducting interviews, observing real-time scenarios, to distributing surveys.

### Focus of Business Analysis Activities

While conducting the analysis, it's imperative to zero in on areas that aid in defining the situation statement. A potential pitfall to avoid is straying into areas that might be irrelevant or not beneficial for defining the future state. It's noteworthy that in instances where a recent detailed assessment of the current state exists, this knowledge can serve as a foundation for the future state without redoing the current state assessment. Also, depending on organizational practices, the team analyzing the current state might differ from the one conducting business analysis for the subsequent project.
