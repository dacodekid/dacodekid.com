## Assess Current State

Assess Current State is a pivotal process in business analysis aimed at scrutinizing the existing organizational landscape. This process serves as the foundation for understanding the inherent complexities and nuances of the environment, thereby enabling effective decision-making for what needs to change to reach the future state. The knowledge gained through this assessment ==provides the necessary context for determining the changes that should be implemented and what should remain as is==.

The scope of analysis can extend to various dimensions within the organization. Whether it's a project, program, or portfolio, or perhaps a particular department, product, or even the competitive market landscape, the assessment endeavors to dissect multiple facets. These facets can range from the organizational structure to existing capabilities, culture, processes, policies, as well as internal and external influencing factors like enterprise architecture and market conditions.

This process offers a more detailed insight than merely identifying the problem or opportunity, as it includes ongoing elicitation activities. Conduct Elicitation is often performed in parallel to further enrich the data and information reservoir.

One of the ==key aspects of this process is the evaluation of the organizationâ€™s current capabilities==. In business analysis terminology, a capability is essentially a skill set or proficiency the organization possesses, which can be a function, process, or service. Understanding these capabilities allows the organization to gauge what is required to either initiate or mature these capabilities to address the identified business need effectively.

==Additionally, this process involves identifying any constraints or limiting factors==, along with their root causes, that may be hampering the organization's ability to address the problem or opportunity. This ensures that these limiting factors are not overlooked when defining the future state.

Various tools and techniques like document analysis, interviews, observation, and surveys are leveraged during this process to collect a broad spectrum of information. Care is taken to ensure that the focus remains on relevant areas that contribute to defining the situation statement, thus avoiding overextension into areas that may not be beneficial or are outside the scope of the issue at hand.

It's important to note that, in some instances, if a recent and thorough assessment of the current state exists, it may negate the need for a redundant exercise. Furthermore, it's possible that different teams within the organization may handle various analytical aspects, depending on the complexity and requirements of the project.
