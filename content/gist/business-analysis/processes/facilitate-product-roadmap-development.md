## Facilitate product roadmap development

Facilitate Product Roadmap Development pertains to the assistance in formulating a product roadmap. This roadmap elucidates, from an overarching perspective, which components of a product are slated for delivery across a portfolio, program, or multiple project phases or releases. Furthermore, it describes the plausible order of delivery for these components. A principal advantage of this process is its ability to foster mutual expectations among stakeholders concerning the deliverables and their likely sequence of delivery.

In the realm of business analysis, product roadmaps serve as a pivotal source of data regarding a product. They offer a glimpse into the product's vision and delineate how it will bolster the organizational strategy, business aims, and objectives over an extended period. The achievement of an organizational strategy is realized through portfolio components, programs, and projects. Here, the product roadmap functions as a bridge connecting organizational strategy and product vision to a tangible plan. This plan is geared towards fulfilling strategic aims and objectives via the product's delivery. On the broader scale of portfolios, product portfolio roadmaps are crafted to determine vision, strategy, and timelines for an ensemble of products.

Crafting a product roadmap is an inclusive task, calling for the joint efforts of business and development personnel. This collaboration is aimed at forging a mutual comprehension of the requisites and the rationale behind them. This procedure might also encompass the creation of diverse "what if" scenarios. These scenarios assist the team in examining multiple planning and delivery alternatives, thereby aiding in the firming up of their final choices. Deliberations are initiated at an elevated level, zooming in on the product's vision. Subsequent discussions delve deeper, eventually pinpointing product releases and their associated features. Roadmaps can also incorporate milestones, indicating when crucial objectives linked to strategic goals are to be achieved.

### pivotal components:

- **Strategy Information**: Elucidates how the product augments the broader organizational strategy. For instance, the product might offer a competitive edge in the market or elevate customer satisfaction.

- **Portfolio**: Denotes the product's association with the portfolio and its linkage to other portfolio products.

- **Program**: Depicts the product's connection to the program and its relation to other program products.

- **Initiatives**: A cursory overview of potential or ongoing projects related to the product.

- **Product Vision**: A comprehensive description of the product, its targeted clientele, and the manner in which it addresses their needs. This vision intertwines the product's development with its underlying purpose.

- **Success Criteria**: Quantifiable metrics to gauge the success of the solution.

- **Market Forces**: External market dynamics that mold or influence the product's development.

- **Product Releases**: Denotes anticipated product releases and their inherent themes or overarching features. Outlining product releases might necessitate making certain assumptions concerning the project lifecycle.

- **Features**: Enumerates the functionalities the product will offer, aligned with product releases. Features are usually prioritized and explicated based on how they bolster the organizational strategy and business objectives.

- **Timelines**: Predicted timeframe for delivering feature sets. This typically spans three to six months for projects adhering to a predictive lifecycle, whereas it's briefer for adaptive methodologies.

While product roadmaps can be articulated as textual documents, they might also be visualized as models. Some organizations harness product roadmap software to craft and convey product roadmap data. Regardless of its formal or informal genesis, it's imperative for product data to be collated and disseminated amongst stakeholders and product teams. This ensures they are cognizant of the product's anticipated trajectory and its role in enabling the organization to meet its targets.

Though primarily utilized internally, product roadmaps also furnish invaluable insights to external entities like customers and vendors. Tailoring the data and its granularity might be requisite based on the audience. For instance, external customers might not require details on a product's alignment with organizational strategy. Confidential aspects might need exclusion from external perusal. Additionally, release dates shared externally might be generic, representing a range rather than specific dates, ensuring reliability and preventing any potential dismay due to date shifts. Conversely, internal stakeholders like product managers would seek intricate details about the product.

### Inputs

#### [Business Goals and Objectives](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Business Goals and Objectives serve as the foundational elements in facilitating product roadmap development. They clearly delineate what the organization is striving to achieve, providing a guiding light for all subsequent analysis. Establishing clear business goals and objectives is crucial as they influence the direction and priorities for product development, ensuring alignment with the overall strategic vision of the enterprise.

#### [Required Capabilities and Features](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/assessment-of-business-value.md)

Required Capabilities and Features represent the specific functionalities and attributes that the product must possess to meet the business goals and objectives. These are derived from a detailed analysis of stakeholder needs, market trends, and technological possibilities. They form the backbone of the product roadmap, as they are the tangible deliverables that will be planned, tracked, and executed over the product's lifecycle.

### Tools and Techniques

#### [Facilitated Workshops](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Facilitated Workshops are structured and collaborative sessions led by a facilitator. They are designed to bring stakeholders together to elicit requirements, gain consensus, and define the vision and strategy for the product roadmap. Through these interactive sessions, valuable insights are garnered, and shared understanding is fostered, both of which are integral to developing a robust and actionable product roadmap.

#### [Feature Model](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Feature Model is a graphical representation of the system's features and their relationships. It is a crucial tool in the product roadmap development process as it helps in organizing and prioritizing features. By delineating the hierarchy and dependencies of features, it aids in strategic planning, decision-making, and communication among stakeholders, ensuring that the roadmap is well-structured and aligns with business objectives.

#### [Product Visioning](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Product Visioning is a forward-looking process that defines the future state of the product in alignment with the business goals and objectives. It serves as a north star for all stakeholders, providing a shared understanding and purpose. This process involves imagining the ideal state of the product, which then informs the planning and prioritization of the features and capabilities in the product roadmap.

#### [Story Mapping](/content/gist/business-analysis/tools-techniques/benchmarking.md)

Story Mapping is an agile-based technique that visually maps out the user journeys and the corresponding features required to support those journeys. It offers a two-dimensional view of the product backlog, helping teams understand the functionality from the user's perspective. Story mapping facilitates the breakdown of large features into smaller, manageable user stories, aiding in the incremental and iterative development of the product roadmap.

### Outputs

#### [Product Roadmap](/content/gist/business-analysis/inputs-outputs/elicitation-results-unconfirmed-confirmed.md)

The Product Roadmap is a strategic document that outlines the vision, direction, priorities, and progress of a product over time. It is a high-level summary that communicates the why, what, and when of product development to all stakeholders. A well-defined product roadmap is instrumental in guiding teams, aligning stakeholders, managing expectations, and ensuring that the product evolves in a manner that is congruent with the business goals and objectives.
